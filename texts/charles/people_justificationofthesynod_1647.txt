A Justification of the Synod of Sion Colledge, against
those, who say they have sate long, and done nothing.
1
THe Synod who dare to controule,
That sit in Sion house,
The people lookt for mountaines, but,
They have brought forth a mouse:
Each man four shillings hath a day,
And do you think theyl lack ho,
When everie man has so much pay,
To drink Wine and Tobacco.
     The Synod have full four years sate
     To find out a Religion,
     Yet to conclude, they know not what,
     They want a new Edition.

2.
Say all wise men, what shall we be,
Brownists, or else Presbyters,
Of the Antinomian Heresie,
Or Independent-Fighters:
Shall we be harmlesse Adamites,
And weare no cloathes upon us,
Or shall we be base Catamites,
And damne Religion from us.
     The Synod have etc.

3.
Shall we be brave Apostolicks,
Or else all turne mad Arrians,
Or shall we leave such cursed tricks
And bee Episcoparians:
Shall wee be of the Sect of Love,
And meet in upper roomes,
And doe as doth the Spirit move,
When as the Sisters comes.
     The Synod have etc.

4.
Or shall we bee, as late we were,
For Government and Order,
And have a King and Monarchie
With Courts, the truth to further:
Shall we have Musick now and Copes,
And kneel as we were wonted,
Instead of Presbyterian Popes,
Have Common-Prayer chaunted.
     The Synod have etc.

5.
Pray tell us, what you do intend,
For, weed be something faine,
Will you our former errours mend,

Or for one give us twaine.
Pray somthing now unto us shew,
Give us the bad, or better:
Or what is old, or what is new,
And each will be your debter.
     The Synod, etc.

6.
I wonder much, that you should want
Your learning, being huge,
You having that same Usurer,
Ycleped Doctor G------
But he good man is neare his end,
The bell now for him toles,
Black-Friers poore have praid for him,
Ere since he sold them coles.
     The Synod, etc.

7.
Methinks, the place should help you make
Some truth for to relie on,
How heavenly King David spake,
When as he dwelt in Sion.
But it may be, in that your place
Things cannot well be scand;
Why then I wish you fild that house
Is in the holy Land.
     The Synod, etc.

8.
The Anabaptists are content
You should sit there for ever,
And say ast please the Parliament,
While they dip in the River:
The Brownists sure well pleased are,
To adde unto your pay,
The Familists do domineere,
Because you nothing say.
The Synod have etc.

9.
The Independents do rejoyce,
They now have won the field,
They say it is the Armies voice,
The Presbyters must yeeld:
Now Case must unto Goodwin stoop,
And Calamie to Dell,
The Presbyters like rushes droop,
O this is wondrous well.
     The Synod, etc.

10.
Some say, like Tinkers you have dealt,
Who mending of a kettle,
Do make two more then ere were felt,
Or els things will not whittle.
And under a most good pretence,
That we should find much ease,
Religion quite is fled from hence,
Pray cure us this disease.
     The Synod, etc.

11.
Dub-dapper Sydrach Sympfon now
Like unto Simia flickers;
A deep and dread revenge doth vow,
On the Schoolmaster Vicars.
And Edwards, that same Hercules,
Will now write his Gangraena,
And therein praise the Sectaries,
The like was never seen-a.
     The Synod, etc.

12.
The Army sweare, they will have none
But Independents sway,
And that the Presbyters each one
In office tother day;
And voted one day, and then nuld,
And then voted againe,
Shall all out of the House be puld,
The others onely raigne.
     The Synod, etc.

13.
And now farewell O Synod brave,
It is in vaine to think,
We a Religion ere shall have,
While that your pockets chink.
Four shillings evry day, besides
Your greazie Benefices,
Makes you to have inlarged sides,
But puls the truth in pieces.
     The Synod have full foure yeares sate,
     To finde out a Religion:
     Yet to conclude they know not what,
     They want a new Edition.
