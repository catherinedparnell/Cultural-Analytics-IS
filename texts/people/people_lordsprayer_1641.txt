A Paraphrase upon the Lords Prayer, and the Creed.
IF any be distrest, and faine would gather
Some comfort, let him hasten to
For we of helpe and hope are all bereaven,
Unlesse thou succour us,

Thou shewest mercy there, and for the same
We praise thee, singing
Of our distresses, Lord, cast up the summe,
Shew us thy joyes, and let

We mortall are, and alter from our birth,
Thou constant art;
Thou mad'st the Earth, Skies, Stars, and Planets seven,
Thy Name be blessed here,

Nothing we have wherewith our debts to pay,
Unlesse thou give to us,
Wherewith to cloath us, wherewith to be fed,
For without thee we want

We want, but want no sinne, for no day passes
But we doe sin:
No man from sinne that ever free did live;
Forgive us, Lord, our sinnes,

If we repent our sinnes thou ne're disdain'st us;
We pardon
Forgive us that is past, and new path tread us;
Direct us alwayes in thy truth,

As thine owne people, and thy chosen Nation,
Into all truth, but
Thou that of all good graces art the giver,
[Permit us not to wander,

Us from th' assaults of World, of Flesh, of Devill,
So shall thy mercies free]
To these Petitions let both Church and Lay-men
With one consent of voyce and heart, say

SInce it be fit that I account should give,
What way unto Salvation
Of my profession here the sum I gather,
First I confesse a faith

In God who without helper or partaker,
Was of himselfe the Worlds
And first gave time his being, who gave breath,
To all the creatures

Our everlasting welfare doth consist,
In his great mercies,
The second person of that three in one,
The Fathers elect, and

That ever blessed and incarnate Word,
Which our Redeemer is, our life,
For why? by Satans guile we were deceiv'd,
Christ was that meanes of helpe,

Yea when we were in danger to be lost,
Conceived for us
And that we might not ever be forlorne,
For our eternall safety he was

Borne as a man, that man might not miscarry,
Even of the substance
And loe a greater mercy and a wonder,
He that can make all suffer

The Jewish spite, which all the world revil'd at,
And Romish tyrannies of
In him I doe beleeve who was envied,
Who with extreamest hate

OUr Father,
--- which art in Heaven,
--- hallowed be thy Name:
--- thy kingdome come:
--- thy will be done on earth,
--- as tis in heaven:
--- give us this day
--- our daily bread:
--- forgive us our trespasses,
--- as we forgive
--- them their trespasses against us:
--- and lead us
--- not into temptation
[--- but deliver
--- us from all evill.]
--- Amen.

I Beleeve
--- in God the Father
--- Almighty maker
--- both of heaven and earth:
--- and in Jesus Christ
--- his onely Sonne,
--- our Lord,
--- which was conceived
--- by the Holy Ghost,
--- borne
--- of the Virgin Mary,
--- suffered under
--- Pontius Pilate,
--- was crucified,

Who being life itselfe, to make assured
Our soules of safety, was both
And that no servile feare in us might dwell,
To conquer

Where no infernall power had power to lay
Command upon him, but on
The force of death and hell he did constraine,
And so in Triumph

Yea the Almighty power advanc't his head,
As well above all things as
Then that from thence gifts might to men be given,
With glory

Where that supreame and everlasting Throne,
Which was prepar'd, he climb'd
That blessed seat where he shall make abode,
To pleade for us at

And no where should he be enthroned rather,
Then there, for he is God as is
And therefore with an equall love delight I,
To praise and serve them both as one

Yet in their office there's a difference,
And I beleeve that Jesus Christ
Shall in that great and universall doome,
Returne, and that with Angels

To question such as at his Empire grudge,
Even those that have presumed him
And that black day shall be so Catholique[,
As I beleeve not only that

Shall to that grand Assize be summoned,]
But he will both adjudge them
Moreover in the Godhead I conceive,
Another Person in whom

For all my hope and blessednesse were lost,
If I beeleeve not
Although vaine Schismaticks through pride and folly
Contemne her power, I doe beleeve

Chaste Spouse of Christ, for whom so many search,
By marks uncertaine, the true
I doe beleeve, God keepe us in this Union,
That there shall be forever

Of Gods elect, and that he still acquaints
His children in the fellowship
Though damned be mens naturall condition,
By grace in Christ I looke for

Of all my foule misdeeds, for there begins
Deaths end, which is the punishment
Moreover I the Sadducees infection
Abhor, and doe beleeve

Yea though I turne to dust, yet through God I,
Expect a glorious rising
And that exempted from the cares here rife,
I shall enjoy perfection,

That is not subject unto change or wasting,
But ever blessed, and for
This is my joy, which that it faile not when
It most should speed me, let God say

     To whom, that he so much vouchsafe me may,
     Thus as a member of the Church I pray.

--- dead and buried,
--- he descended into hell,
--- the third day
--- he arose againe
--- from the dead,
--- he ascended into heaven
--- and sitteth on,
--- the right hand of God,
--- the Father,
--- Almighty:
--- from thence
--- he shall come
--- to judge
[--- the quicke
--- and the dead:]
--- I doe beleeve
--- in the Holy Ghost,
--- the holy
--- Catholick Church,
--- the Communion
--- of Saints,
--- the remission
--- of sinnes,
--- the resurrection
--- of the body,
--- and the life
--- everlasting.
--- Amen.
