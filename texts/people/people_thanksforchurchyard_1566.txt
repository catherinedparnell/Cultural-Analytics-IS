A greatter thanks, for Churchyardes
welcome home.
I Bad not Courte farewell
     for such hot welcome home,
But glad to leave the costly Courte
     and lyve lyke cuntrye mome.

From thence I wyllyng went:
     and thought in very deed,
To make (ere mischeefs fel on heapes)
     a Vertue of a need.

But my cheeff freend came there,
     to whome for duties sake
I rode, and did (by destinies lot)
     a further journey make.

Which freend drew me by love,
     to see the Courte agayne:
But sens my suddayn comming there
     doth breed in you disdayne:

I fynd more fumish flames,
     by this fond frantike smoke:
And see (perhaps) a further fyer,
     then you with craft can cloke.

But tyll your fyngers burne,
     ye care not what ye doe:
Well, I wyll helpe to kyndle coales,
     and clap on faggots toe.

To bryng your handes in heat,
     because the ayre is colde:
Ka. me: Knave thee: I say no more,
     the proverbe is full olde.

Yf Crowes of Cheape cry Ka,
     the bawle doth backe rebound:
For sure I owe not all their towne,
     the halfe of twentie pound.

And thyrteene candels great,
     o every pound allowe:
Then call an audite of my debt,
     and cast my charges nowe.

Yet know I cut tayld Curres,
     can never byght in frame:
Tyll courage claps them on the backs
     and thrusts them on the game.

Come on you snarryng whelpes
     I feare your force no whit:
Though lowd ye bark ye dare not byte
     your teeth are tender yet.

Baight me lyke Bull at stake,
     I have good flesh and bone:
To trie it out (as hap shall serve)
     with any Dog alone.

No other aunswer sure,
     I make: now skan this well:
But leave the Lob that rayld on me,
     the bable and the bell.

Write not to this agayne,
     in silence shall ye sit:
As voyde of aunswer every way,
     as you are voyd of wyt.
