A Looking-glasse,
For Murtherers and Blasphemers; wherein they [?]
Gods judgement showne upon a Keeper neere Enfield C[hase]
desperately shot at [a] [M]an that intended to have stolne Deere, [?]
This was done on Monday night, the xii. day of June, being the same da[y] [?]
Tempest was in London. To the Tune of Jasper Cunningha[m]
YOu desperate Swearers,
     and foule Blasphemers all,
Give eare unto an accident,
     which lately did befall,
Upon a wicked Keeper,
     God did his Judgement show,
Neere to the Chase of Enfield,
     as many People know.

Then lend atention
     to that which I repeate,
Wherein you may admire
     Gods judgements wondrous great,
And learne blasphemous Swearing
     to fl[e]e, for God sayes plaine,
He will not hold him guiltlesse
     that takes his Name in vaine.

Now to my Story
     I come with trembling feare,
A lewd ungodly Liver
     one night was stealing Deere:
The Keepers that with vigelance
     there nightly round did keepe,
Upon this Venson-stealer
     most subtilly did creepe.

And having him encompast,
     he could not scape away,
One Keeper to an other
     in desperate wise did say,
Now will I shoote this Fellow,
     according to the Law,
And thereupon, his Crosse-bowe
     he sodainely did draw.

The other being milde[r]
     did seeke to turne his [?]
And sayd let us not kill [?]
     some other course we[?]
Here will we apprehen[d]
     for this his lawles dee[d] [?]
That by the course of [?]
     Law may on him pro[?]

The other being grace[?]
     and given un[to] strife, [?]
Sayd, if he b[?] Dee[?]
     or Man, Ile [ha]ve his [?]
This is my resolution [?]
     at him I meane to sh[?]
And therefore to dissw[ade]
     alas it is no boote.

With those blasphemo[us] [?]
     his Crosse-bowe up h[?]
And aymed at the Fel[low]
     whose breast with for[?]
And him of Life depri[ved]
     but marke the power [?]
Who at that instant se[?]
     did scourge him with [?]

For to this instant tim[?]
     he in that place doth f[?]
So holding of his Cro[?]
     within the shooting h[?]
Thers none that can re[?]
     by any strength or sk[ill]
And as he first stood shoo[?]
     so now he standeth st[ill]

The Second Part. To the same Tune.
ALso his wicked
     prophane blasphemous toung,
Which with vile swearing
     had done his Maker wrong,
Out of his mouth now hangeth
     that every one may view
How God rewards Blasphemers
     and giveth them there due.

One thing is worthy
     to bee observed well,
That at the season
     when this strange thing befell,
A Tempest fell in London
     upon that very day,
And this was done within that night
     as many people say.

If all Blasphemers
     in this kinde were serv'd,
Gods holy Precepts
     would better be observ'd,
But let all men be warn'd
     to flee this foule offence,
Which doth the Lord to anger
     above all sinns incence.

And let all murtherers
     be warned by this tale,
For God such foule offences
     to punish will not fayle,
Oh doe not seeke for vengeance
     which to the Lord belongs,
Who will when he thinkes fitting
     revenge his servants wronges.

Also this is a warning
     for those that live by stealing,
The Lord sevearely plagueth those
     who live by such false dealing,
As now he hath this wreched Theefe
     who died in his sinns,
And few that runn so vile a race
     a better ending winns.

What ere you be give not your mind
     to live by pilfering theft,
But larne to labour with your hands
     and use some honest shift,
Then God will blesse your labours
     what ere you take in hand,
And every thing shall prosper
     as well by sea as land.

In fine, let all bee warn'd
     at this Gods Judgement showne,
And think if you offende the like
     the case may be your owne,
Provoke not God to execute
     his wrath on you for sinn,
But by'th example of these twayne
     to mend your lives begin.
