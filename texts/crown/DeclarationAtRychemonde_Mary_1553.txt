By the Quene,
THe Quenes highnes well remembrynge what great inconuenience and daungers haue growen to this her hyghnes realme in tyme past thorough the diuersitie of opinions, in questions of re|ligion, and hearing also that now of late, sithens the begynning of her moost graciouse reygne, the same contentions be agayne muche renewed thorowe certeyne false and vntrue reportes and eumors spredde by some lyght and euyll disposed persons, hath thought good to do to vnderstande to all her hyghnes moost louynge and obedient subiectes, her mooste gratious pleasure, in maner and fourme folowynge.
FYRST her maiestie being presently by thonely goodnes of God settled in her iust possession of thimperiall crowne of this realme, and other dominions therunto belongynge, can not nowe hyde that religion (whiche GOD and the worlde knoweth the hath euer professed from her infancy hitherto) whiche as her maiestie is mynded to obserue and maynteyne for her selfe by gods grace durynge her tyme, so dothe her highnes muche desyre, and woulde be gladde the same were of all her subiectes quietly and charitablye embraced. And yet she doth signifye vnto all her maiesties sayde louinge subiectes, that of her moost gratious disposition and clemency, her highnes myndeth not to compell any her sayde subiectes thervnto, vnto suche tyme as further ordre by common assent maye be taken therein. Forbyddinge neuerthelesse, all her subiectes of all degrees, at theyr perylles, to moue sedicions, or to styrre vnquietnes in her people by interpretyng the lawes of this realme after theyr braynes and fansies, but quietly to continue for the tyme, tyl asbefore is sayde further order maye be taken. And therefore wylleth and streyghtly chargeth and commaundeth all her sayde good louynge subiectes, to lyue togethers in quiet sorte, & chri|stian charitie, leauynge those newe founde deuelishe termes of Papyste or Heretique, and suche lyke, and applyenge theyr whole eares, studye, and trauayle, to lyue in the feare of God, exercising theyr conuersations in suche charitable and godlye doynge, as theyr liues maye in dede expresse that great hunger and thyrst of Goddes glorye and holye worde, whiche by rashe talke and wor|des many haue pretended, and in so doynge, as they shall best please GOD, and lyue withoute daunger of the lawes, and maynteyne the tranquillite of the realme, wherof her hyghnesse shalbe most gladde: so yfanye man shall rashelye presume to make any assembles of people, or at any publique assembles or otherwyse, shall go aboute to styrre the people to disorder, or disquiet, she myndeth accordinge to her duetye, to see the same moost seuerely refourmed and punyshed, accordyng to her hygnesse lawes.
AND furthermore, forasmuche also as it is well knowen, that sedition and false rumours haue bene nouryshed and maynteyned in this realme, by the subteltye and malyce of some euell disposed persons, whiche take vpon them withoute sufficient auctoritie, to preache, and to interprete the worde of GOD, after theyr owne brayne, in churches and other places, both publique and pryuate. And also by playinge of Interludes and pryntynge of false fonde bookes, ballettes, rymes, and other lewde treatises in the englyshe tonge, concernynge doctryne in matters now in question and controuersye, touchynge the hyghe poyntes and misteries of christen religion, whiche bokes, ballettes, rymes, and treatises are chiefly by the Prynters and Stacioners sette out to sale to her graces subiectes, of an euyll zeale, for lucre and couetous of vyle gayne. Her highnes therfore strayghtly chargeth and commaundeth all and euery her sayde subiectes, of whatsoeuer
