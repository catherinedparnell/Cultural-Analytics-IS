Â¶ AN ACTE FOR THE UNIFORMITIE OF COMMON

PRAIER, AND SERVICE IN THE CHURCH, AND THE ADMINIS-

TRACION OF THE SACRAMENTES.

WHERE at the death of oure late Soveraigne lord King Edward the sixt, there remained one uniforme order of common service and prayer, and of the administracion of Sacramentes, Rites, and Ceremonies, in the churche of Englande, whiche was set furth in one booke entituled: The booke of common prayer, and administracion of Sacramentes, and other Rites and ceremonies in the churche of Englande, aucthorised by Act of Parliament, holden in the fift [fifth] and sixt yeres of our saied late Soueraigne lorde kyng Edward the sixte, intituled An acte for the uniformitie of Common prayer, and administracion of the Sacramentes, the which was repealed and taken away by acte of parliament, in the first yere of the raygne of our late Soveraigne Ladye Quene Marye, to the great decaye of the due honour of God, and discomfort to the professours of the trueth of Christes religion :

THE PREFACE.

THERE was never anye thynge by the witte of man so well devised, or so sure established, whiche (in continuaunce of tyme) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thynges) it may plainly appeare by the Common prayers in the churche, commonly called divine service: the firste originall and ground wherof, if a man woulde serche out by auncient fathers, he shall fynde that the same was not ordeyned but of a good purpose, and for a greate advauncemente of godlines. For they so ordred the matter, that all the whole Byble (or the gretest part therof) should be red over ones [once] in the yere entending therby, that the clergie and specially suche as wer Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often reading and meditacion of Gods word), be styrred up to godlines themselves, and be more able also to exhorte other [others] by holesome doctrine, and to confute them that wer adversaries to the truth. And further that the people (by daily hearynge of holy scripture read in the Churche) should continually profite more and more in the knowelege of God, and be the more enflamed with the love of his true religion. But these many yeres passed, thys godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain Stories, Legendes, Respondes, Verses, vain Repeticions, Commemoracions, and Sinodalles [Synodals], that commonly when any booke of the Bible was begon, before thre or foure Chapiters wer red out, al the rest wer unredde. And in this sort the booke of Esay [Isaiah] was begon in Advent, and the boke of Genesis in Septuagesima : but they were onely begonne, and never red through. After lyke sorte wer other bokes of holy scripture used. And moreover, wheras Sainct Paule woulde have such language spoken to the people in the Churche, as they might onderstande, and have profite by hearing thesame, the service in this churche of Englande (these many yeres) hath been redde in Latine to the people, whiche they understoode not, so that they have heard with their eares only, and their hartes, spirite, and mynd, have not been edified therby. And furthermore, notwithstandyng that thauncient fathers have devyded the Psalmes into seven porcions, wherof every one was called a Nocturne, now of late tyme, a fewe of them have been daily sayd (and oft repeated) and the rest utterly omitted. Moreover, the nombre and hardnesse of the rules, called the Pye, and the manifolde changeinges [changes] of the service, was the cause, that to turne the boke onely, was so harde and intricate a matter, that many tymes there was more businesse to find out what should be read, then to reade it when it was found out.

These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set furthe suche an ordre, whereby thesame shalbe redressed. And for a readinesse in this matter, here is drawen out a kalendre for that purpose, which is plain and easy to be understanden [understood], wherin (so muche as may be) the reading of holy scriptures is so set furth, that all thinges shalbe doen in ordre, without breaking one piece therof from another. For this cause be cut of Anthemes, Respondes, Invitatories, and such lyke thinges, as dyd breake the continual course of the reading of the scripture. Yet because ther is no remedy, but that of necessitie there must be some rules, therefore certayn rules are here set furth, which as they be fewe in nombre, so they be plain and easy to be onderstanden. So that here you have an ordre for prayer (as touching the reading of holy scripture) much agreable to the mynd and purpose of thold fathers, and a great deale more profitable and commodious, then that which of late was used. It is more profitable, because here are left out many thinges, whereof some be untrue, some uncertayn, some vain and supersticious, and is ordeyned nothing to be readde but the very pure woord of God, the holye scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language and ordre, as is most easy and playne for the understandyng bothe of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, bothe for the shortnesse therof, and for the playnesse of the ordre, and for that the rules be fewe and easye. Furthermore, by thys ordre, the Curates shall nede none other bookes for their publique service, but this booke, and the Bible, by the meanes wherof, the people shal not be at so greate charge for bookes, as in tyme paste they have been.

And where hertofore there hath been greate diversitie, in saying, and singyng in churches within thys realme, some folowing Salisburye use, some Herford use, some the use of Bangor, some of Yorke, and some of Lincolne: now from hence furth, all the whole realme, shall have but one use. And if any would judge this way more paynfull, because that all thynges must be readde upon the booke, wheras before by the reason of so often repeticion, they could say many thinges by heart; if those men will weigh their labour, with the profite and knowledge, which daily they shall obteyne by readyng upon the booke, they will not refuse the pein, in consideracion of the great profite that shal ensue therof.

And forasmuche as nothyng can almost be so playnly set furth, but doubtes may ryse in the use and practising of the same: To appease all such diversitie (if any aryse), and for the resolucion of all doubtes concerning the maner howe to understand, do, and execute the thinges conteined in this boke: the parties that so dout [doubt], or diversly take any thing, shal alway resort to the Bishoppe of the dyocesse, who by hys discrecion shall take ordre for the quyeting and appeasing of the same : so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteyned in this booke. And yf the the Byshoppe of the Dyocesse be in any doubte, then may he sende for the resolucion therof unto the Archebishoppe.

Though it be appoyncted in the afore written Preface, that all thynges shalbe readde and song in the Church, in the Englishe tongue, to the ende that the congregacion may bee thereby edifyed; yet it is not meant, but when men say Mornyng and Evening prayer privately, they may say thesame in any language that they themselves do understande.

And all Priestes and Deacons, shalbe bounde to say dayly, the Morning and Evenyng prayer, eyther privately or openly, except they be letted [=prevented] by preaching, studying of divinitie, or by some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministreth in every paryshe Churche or Chapell, beyng at home, and not beyng otherwyse reasonably letted [=prevented], shall say thesame in the Parishe Church or Chapell where he ministreth, and shall toll a belle therto, a convenient tyme before he begyn, that such as be disposed may come to heare Goddes woorde, and to praye with him.

OF CEREMONIES,



WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED, AND SOME RETAYNED.



OF suche Ceremonies as be used in the churche,and have hadde their beginning by the institucion of man : Some at the firste were of Godlye entent and purpose devysed, and yet at length, turned to vanitie and supersticion : some entered into the Churche, by undiscrete devocion and suche a zeale as was withoute knowledge: and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grue daily to more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitablenes, but also because they have muche blynded the people, and obscured the glorye of God, are woorthy to be cut away, and cleane rejected. Other there be, which although they have been devysed by manne, yet it is thought good, to reserve them still, aswel for a decent ordre in the churche (for the which they wer first devised) as because they pertaine to edificacion : wherunto all thinges doen in the Churche (as the Apostle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the kepyng or omitting of a Ceremonye (in it selfe considered) is but a small thyng : yet the wilfull and contempteous transgression, and breakyng of a common ordre, and discipline : is no small offence before God.

Let all thynges be doen emong you (saith S. Paule) in a semelye and dewe ordre. The appoynctment of the which ordre, perteyneth not to private men; therefore no man ought to take in hande, nor presume to appoincte or alter any publique or common ordre in Christes Church, excepte he be lawfully called and aucthorised therunto.

And wheras as in this our tyme, the mindes of menne are so diverse, that some thinke it a great matter of conscience, to departe from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies (they be so addicted to their old customes) and again on the other side, some be so newe fangled, that they would innovate all thing, and so do despise the olde, that nothing can like them, but that is newe: it was thought expedient, not so muche to have respect how to please and satisfie either of these parties, as how to please God, and profite them bothe. And yet lest anye man shoulde be offended (whom good reason might satisfie) here be certain causes rendered why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some retained and kept still.

Some are put away, because the great excesse and multitude of them, bath so encreased in these latter days, that the burthen of them was intollerable; whereof S. Augustine in his tyme complained, that they were growe to suche a nombre, that the state of christian people was in worse case (concerning that matter) then wer the Jewes. And he counsailed that such yoke and burthen shoulde be taken away, as tyme woulde serve quietly to doe it.

But what woulde sainct Augustine have sayde, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late dayes used emong us? wherunto the multitude used in his time was not to bee compared. This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was so greate, and many of them so darke, that they did more confounde and darken, then declare and set furthe Christes benefites unto us.

And besides this, Christes Ghospell is not a Ceremoniall lawe (as muche of Moses lawe was) but it is a religion to serve God, not in bondage of the figure, or shadowe, but in the fredome of spirite, beyng content onelye with those Ceremonies, which doe serve to a decent ordre, and godlye discipline, and suche as be apte to styrre up the dull minde of manne, to the remembraunce of his duetie to God, by some notable and speciall significacion, whereby he might be edified.

Furthermore, the moste weightie cause of the abolishement of certain Ceremonies was, that thei wer so farre abused, partly by the supersticious blindnesse of the rude and unlearned, and partly by the unsaciable avarice of such as sought more their owne lucre, then the glorye of God: that the abuses could not well be taken awaye, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persones, whiche peradventure will bee offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained stil: if thei consider, that without some Ceremonies it is not possible to kepe anye ordre, or quyet discipline in the Churche, they shall easely perceive just cause to refourme their judugementes. And if they thinke muche that anye of the olde dooe remain, and would rather have all devysed newe: Then such men graunting some Ceremonies convenient to be had, surelye where the olde maye be well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove thold onely for their age without bewraying [betraying] of their awn foly. For in such a case, they ought rather to have reverence unto them, for their antiquitie, if they will declare themselfes to be more studious of unitie and concord, then of innovacions and new fanglenesse, whiche (asmuch as maye bee with the true settyng furth of Chrystes Religion) is alwayes to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause with the Ceremonies reserved, to be offended: For as those bee taken away, whiche wer moste abused, and dyd burthen mennes conscionces without any cause: so the other that remain are retained for a Dysciplyne and ordre, whiche (upon just causes) maye bee altered and chaunged, and therfore are not to be estemed equall with Goddes lawe. And moreover thei be neither darke nor dombe Ceremonies, but are so set furthe, that everye manne may understand what they dooe meane, and to what use they dooe serve. So that it is not lyke, that they in tyme to come, shoulde bee abused, as the other have been. And in these oure doynges, we condempne no other nacions, nor prescribe any thing, but to our awne people onelye. For wee thinke it convenient that every countrey should use such Ceremonies, as they shall thinke best, to the setting furth of Goddes honour, or glorye, and to the reducyng of the people to a moste perfect and Godly livyng, without errour or Supersticion. And that they should put away other thynges, whiche from tyme to tyme, they perceyve to bee moste abused, as in mennes ordinaunces, it often chaunceth diversely in divers countreys.

WHERE at the death of oure late Soveraigne lord King Edward the sixt, there remained one uniforme order of common service and prayer, and of the administracion of Sacramentes, Rites, and Ceremonies, in the churche of Englande, whiche was set furth in one booke entituled: The booke of common prayer, and administracion of Sacramentes, and other Rites and ceremonies in the churche of Englande, aucthorised by Act of Parliament, holden in the fift [fifth] and sixt yeres of our saied late Soueraigne lorde kyng Edward the sixte, intituled An acte for the uniformitie of Common prayer, and administracion of the Sacramentes, the which was repealed and taken away by acte of parliament, in the first yere of the raygne of our late Soveraigne Ladye Quene Marye, to the great decaye of the due honour of God, and discomfort to the professours of the trueth of Christes religion :

THE PREFACE.

THERE was never anye thynge by the witte of man so well devised, or so sure established, whiche (in continuaunce of tyme) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thynges) it may plainly appeare by the Common prayers in the churche, commonly called divine service: the firste originall and ground wherof, if a man woulde serche out by auncient fathers, he shall fynde that the same was not ordeyned but of a good purpose, and for a greate advauncemente of godlines. For they so ordred the matter, that all the whole Byble (or the gretest part therof) should be red over ones [once] in the yere entending therby, that the clergie and specially suche as wer Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often reading and meditacion of Gods word), be styrred up to godlines themselves, and be more able also to exhorte other [others] by holesome doctrine, and to confute them that wer adversaries to the truth. And further that the people (by daily hearynge of holy scripture read in the Churche) should continually profite more and more in the knowelege of God, and be the more enflamed with the love of his true religion. But these many yeres passed, thys godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain Stories, Legendes, Respondes, Verses, vain Repeticions, Commemoracions, and Sinodalles [Synodals], that commonly when any booke of the Bible was begon, before thre or foure Chapiters wer red out, al the rest wer unredde. And in this sort the booke of Esay [Isaiah] was begon in Advent, and the boke of Genesis in Septuagesima : but they were onely begonne, and never red through. After lyke sorte wer other bokes of holy scripture used. And moreover, wheras Sainct Paule woulde have such language spoken to the people in the Churche, as they might onderstande, and have profite by hearing thesame, the service in this churche of Englande (these many yeres) hath been redde in Latine to the people, whiche they understoode not, so that they have heard with their eares only, and their hartes, spirite, and mynd, have not been edified therby. And furthermore, notwithstandyng that thauncient fathers have devyded the Psalmes into seven porcions, wherof every one was called a Nocturne, now of late tyme, a fewe of them have been daily sayd (and oft repeated) and the rest utterly omitted. Moreover, the nombre and hardnesse of the rules, called the Pye, and the manifolde changeinges [changes] of the service, was the cause, that to turne the boke onely, was so harde and intricate a matter, that many tymes there was more businesse to find out what should be read, then to reade it when it was found out.

These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set furthe suche an ordre, whereby thesame shalbe redressed. And for a readinesse in this matter, here is drawen out a kalendre for that purpose, which is plain and easy to be understanden [understood], wherin (so muche as may be) the reading of holy scriptures is so set furth, that all thinges shalbe doen in ordre, without breaking one piece therof from another. For this cause be cut of Anthemes, Respondes, Invitatories, and such lyke thinges, as dyd breake the continual course of the reading of the scripture. Yet because ther is no remedy, but that of necessitie there must be some rules, therefore certayn rules are here set furth, which as they be fewe in nombre, so they be plain and easy to be onderstanden. So that here you have an ordre for prayer (as touching the reading of holy scripture) much agreable to the mynd and purpose of thold fathers, and a great deale more profitable and commodious, then that which of late was used. It is more profitable, because here are left out many thinges, whereof some be untrue, some uncertayn, some vain and supersticious, and is ordeyned nothing to be readde but the very pure woord of God, the holye scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language and ordre, as is most easy and playne for the understandyng bothe of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, bothe for the shortnesse therof, and for the playnesse of the ordre, and for that the rules be fewe and easye. Furthermore, by thys ordre, the Curates shall nede none other bookes for their publique service, but this booke, and the Bible, by the meanes wherof, the people shal not be at so greate charge for bookes, as in tyme paste they have been.

And where hertofore there hath been greate diversitie, in saying, and singyng in churches within thys realme, some folowing Salisburye use, some Herford use, some the use of Bangor, some of Yorke, and some of Lincolne: now from hence furth, all the whole realme, shall have but one use. And if any would judge this way more paynfull, because that all thynges must be readde upon the booke, wheras before by the reason of so often repeticion, they could say many thinges by heart; if those men will weigh their labour, with the profite and knowledge, which daily they shall obteyne by readyng upon the booke, they will not refuse the pein, in consideracion of the great profite that shal ensue therof.

And forasmuche as nothyng can almost be so playnly set furth, but doubtes may ryse in the use and practising of the same: To appease all such diversitie (if any aryse), and for the resolucion of all doubtes concerning the maner howe to understand, do, and execute the thinges conteined in this boke: the parties that so dout [doubt], or diversly take any thing, shal alway resort to the Bishoppe of the dyocesse, who by hys discrecion shall take ordre for the quyeting and appeasing of the same : so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteyned in this booke. And yf the the Byshoppe of the Dyocesse be in any doubte, then may he sende for the resolucion therof unto the Archebishoppe.

Though it be appoyncted in the afore written Preface, that all thynges shalbe readde and song in the Church, in the Englishe tongue, to the ende that the congregacion may bee thereby edifyed; yet it is not meant, but when men say Mornyng and Evening prayer privately, they may say thesame in any language that they themselves do understande.

And all Priestes and Deacons, shalbe bounde to say dayly, the Morning and Evenyng prayer, eyther privately or openly, except they be letted [=prevented] by preaching, studying of divinitie, or by some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministreth in every paryshe Churche or Chapell, beyng at home, and not beyng otherwyse reasonably letted [=prevented], shall say thesame in the Parishe Church or Chapell where he ministreth, and shall toll a belle therto, a convenient tyme before he begyn, that such as be disposed may come to heare Goddes woorde, and to praye with him.

The wording of the Preface was changed in a number of minor ways at various times throughout the life of this book.

OF CEREMONIES,



WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED, AND SOME RETAYNED.



OF suche Ceremonies as be used in the churche,and have hadde their beginning by the institucion of man : Some at the firste were of Godlye entent and purpose devysed, and yet at length, turned to vanitie and supersticion : some entered into the Churche, by undiscrete devocion and suche a zeale as was withoute knowledge: and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grue daily to more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitablenes, but also because they have muche blynded the people, and obscured the glorye of God, are woorthy to be cut away, and cleane rejected. Other there be, which although they have been devysed by manne, yet it is thought good, to reserve them still, aswel for a decent ordre in the churche (for the which they wer first devised) as because they pertaine to edificacion : wherunto all thinges doen in the Churche (as the Apostle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the kepyng or omitting of a Ceremonye (in it selfe considered) is but a small thyng : yet the wilfull and contempteous transgression, and breakyng of a common ordre, and discipline : is no small offence before God.

Let all thynges be doen emong you (saith S. Paule) in a semelye and dewe ordre. The appoynctment of the which ordre, perteyneth not to private men; therefore no man ought to take in hande, nor presume to appoincte or alter any publique or common ordre in Christes Church, excepte he be lawfully called and aucthorised therunto.

And wheras as in this our tyme, the mindes of menne are so diverse, that some thinke it a great matter of conscience, to departe from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies (they be so addicted to their old customes) and again on the other side, some be so newe fangled, that they would innovate all thing, and so do despise the olde, that nothing can like them, but that is newe: it was thought expedient, not so muche to have respect how to please and satisfie either of these parties, as how to please God, and profite them bothe. And yet lest anye man shoulde be offended (whom good reason might satisfie) here be certain causes rendered why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some retained and kept still.

Some are put away, because the great excesse and multitude of them, bath so encreased in these latter days, that the burthen of them was intollerable; whereof S. Augustine in his tyme complained, that they were growe to suche a nombre, that the state of christian people was in worse case (concerning that matter) then wer the Jewes. And he counsailed that such yoke and burthen shoulde be taken away, as tyme woulde serve quietly to doe it.

But what woulde sainct Augustine have sayde, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late dayes used emong us? wherunto the multitude used in his time was not to bee compared. This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was so greate, and many of them so darke, that they did more confounde and darken, then declare and set furthe Christes benefites unto us.

And besides this, Christes Ghospell is not a Ceremoniall lawe (as muche of Moses lawe was) but it is a religion to serve God, not in bondage of the figure, or shadowe, but in the fredome of spirite, beyng content onelye with those Ceremonies, which doe serve to a decent ordre, and godlye discipline, and suche as be apte to styrre up the dull minde of manne, to the remembraunce of his duetie to God, by some notable and speciall significacion, whereby he might be edified.

Furthermore, the moste weightie cause of the abolishement of certain Ceremonies was, that thei wer so farre abused, partly by the supersticious blindnesse of the rude and unlearned, and partly by the unsaciable avarice of such as sought more their owne lucre, then the glorye of God: that the abuses could not well be taken awaye, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persones, whiche peradventure will bee offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained stil: if thei consider, that without some Ceremonies it is not possible to kepe anye ordre, or quyet discipline in the Churche, they shall easely perceive just cause to refourme their judugementes. And if they thinke muche that anye of the olde dooe remain, and would rather have all devysed newe: Then such men graunting some Ceremonies convenient to be had, surelye where the olde maye be well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove thold onely for their age without bewraying [betraying] of their awn foly. For in such a case, they ought rather to have reverence unto them, for their antiquitie, if they will declare themselfes to be more studious of unitie and concord, then of innovacions and new fanglenesse, whiche (asmuch as maye bee with the true settyng furth of Chrystes Religion) is alwayes to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause with the Ceremonies reserved, to be offended: For as those bee taken away, whiche wer moste abused, and dyd burthen mennes conscionces without any cause: so the other that remain are retained for a Dysciplyne and ordre, whiche (upon just causes) maye bee altered and chaunged, and therfore are not to be estemed equall with Goddes lawe. And moreover thei be neither darke nor dombe Ceremonies, but are so set furthe, that everye manne may understand what they dooe meane, and to what use they dooe serve. So that it is not lyke, that they in tyme to come, shoulde bee abused, as the other have been. And in these oure doynges, we condempne no other nacions, nor prescribe any thing, but to our awne people onelye. For wee thinke it convenient that every countrey should use such Ceremonies, as they shall thinke best, to the setting furth of Goddes honour, or glorye, and to the reducyng of the people to a moste perfect and Godly livyng, without errour or Supersticion. And that they should put away other thynges, whiche from tyme to tyme, they perceyve to bee moste abused, as in mennes ordinaunces, it often chaunceth diversely in divers countreys.

THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

EXPRESSYNG THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMES AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YERE, EXCEPTE CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTES, AS THE RULES FOLOWYNG

MORE PLAYNELY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YERE, EXCEPTE CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTES, AS THE RULES FOLOWYNG

MORE PLAYNELY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND KALENDAR

EXPRESSYNG THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMES AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YERE, EXCEPTE CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTES, AS THE RULES FOLOWYNG

MORE PLAYNELY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YERE, EXCEPTE CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTES, AS THE RULES FOLOWYNG

MORE PLAYNELY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND KALENDAR

EXPRESSYNG THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMES AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YERE, EXCEPTE CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTES, AS THE RULES FOLOWYNG

MORE PLAYNELY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOYNTED TO BE READDE.

THE Psalter shalbe readde through, ones euery moneth, and because that some Monethes bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this meanes.

To every moneth shalbe appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx dayes.

And because January and Marche hathe one daye above the sayed nomber, and February, which is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely xxviii dayes, February shall borow of either of the monethes (of January and Marche) one day, and so the Psalter, which shalbe redde in February, must begin the last daie of January, and ende the first daie of Marche.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi dayes a pece, it is ordred that the same Psalmes shalbe redde the haste day of the sayed Monethes, which were redde the daye before, so that the Psalter may beginne againe the first daie of the next Monethe ensuyng.

Now to knowe what Psalmes shalbe redde every daie, looke in the Kalender, the nomber that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then fynde thesame nomber in this Table, and upon that nomber shall you see, what Psalmes shalbe sayde at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalme, is devided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be redde at one time: it is so ordred, that, at one time, shal not be readde above foure or fyve of the sayd porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table folowyng.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other partes of the service, where any Psalmes are appoyncted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englyshe Bible, whiche from the ix Psalme, unto the cxlviii Psalme (folowing the devision of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latine translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Beginneth

and Endeth

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term beginneth always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And endeth the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term beginneth alway the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and endeth the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term beginneth the ninth or tenth day of October and endeth the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term beginneth the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and endeth the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

Â¶ THE MINISTRACION OF BAPTISME

TO BE USED IN THE CHURCHE.

It appeareth by auncient writers, that the Sacrament of Baptisme in the old old tyme, was not commonly Ministred, but at two times in the yeare, at Easter and Whytsontide, at which tymes it was openly ministred in the presence of al the congregacion: which custome (now being growen out of use,) although it can not for many consideracions bee well restored agayne, yet it is thought good to folow the same as nere as conveniently may be. Wherfore the people are to be admonished, that it is most convenient that Baptisme should not be ministred but upon Sondayes, and other holy dayes, when the most nombre of people may come together, aswel for that the congregacion there present maye testifie the receyving of them that be newly Baptized into the nomber of Christes Church, as also because in the Baptisme of Infants everye man present may be put in remembraunce of his awne profession made to God in hys Baptisme. For which cause also, it is expedient that Baptisme be ministred in the English tongue. Nevertheles (if necessitie so require) children may at al tymes be Baptized at home.

Â¶	When there are children to he baptized upon the Sonday, or holy day, the parentes shal geve knowledge over nighte, or in the morning, afore the beginning of Mornyng prayour, to the curate. A nd then the Godfathers, Godmothers, and people with the children, must be ready at the Fonte, eyther immediatly after the last Lesson at Morning Prayour, or els immediatly after the last Lesson at Evening Praiour, as the Curat by his discretion shall appoincte. And then standinge there, the Priest shall ask whether the children be Baptized or no. If they aunswer, No. Then the priest say thus.

DERELY beloved, forasmuche as al men be conceived and borne in synne, and that our saviour Christ saith, none can entre into the kingdom of God (except he be regenerate, and borne a new of water and the holy gost) I beseche you to cal upon God the father, throughe our lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy, he wil graunt to these children, that thing which by nature thei can not have, that they may be baptized with water and the holy Ghost, and received into Christes holy church; and be made lively membres of the same.

Then the Priest shall say.

Let us praye.

ALMIGHTIE and everlasting God, whiche of thy great mercy diddest save Noe and his familie in the Arcke, from perishing by water, and also diddest saufly lead the children of Israel, thy people, through the redde Sea, figuring therby thy holy Baptisme: and by the Baptisme of thy welbeloved sonne Jesus Christe, diddest sanctifye the floude Jordane, and al other waters, to the mistical washinge away of synne: We beseche the (for thine infinite mercies) that thou wilte mercifully loke upon these children, sanctify them and washe them with thy* holy gost, that they beyng delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the Arcke of Christes churche, and beyng stedfast in faithe, joyfull throughe hope, and roted in charitie, may so passe the waves of this troublesome world, that finally they may come to the lande of everlasting life, there to reigne with the, worlde without ende, through Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.



* "the" in 1604.





ALMIGHTY and immortal God, the aide of al that nede, the helper of al that fly to the for succour, the life of them that beleve, and the resurrection of the deade, we cal upon the for these infantes, that they, comming to thy holy Baptisme, may receyve remission of their sinnes by spiritual regeneracion, receive them (O Lorde) as thou haste promised by thy welbeloved sonne, saynge: Aske and you shall have; seke, and you shall fynde: knocke and it shalbe opened unto you: So geve now unto us that aske. Let us that seeke, fynde open thy gate unto us that knocke, that these infantes enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly wasshing, and may come to the eternal kingdome whiche thou haste promised by Christ our Lorde. Amen.

Â¶ Then shall the Priest saye

Heare the words of the Gospel, written by Sainct Marke in the tenth Chapiter.





AT a certayne tyme they brought children to Christ that he should touche theim, and his Disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus sawe it, he was displeased, and sayde unto them. Suifre lytle children to come unto me, and forbydde them not; For to suche belongeth the Kyngdome of God. Verely, I saye unto you; whosoever doeth not receive the kingdome of God, as a lytle chylde: he shall not entre therin. And when he had taken the up in his armes: he put his handes upon them, and blessed them.

Â¶ After the Gospel is redde, the minister shal make this briefe exhortacion upon the wordes of the Gospell.

FRENDES, ye heare in this Gospell the woordes of our saviour Christe, that he commaunded the chyldren to bee broughte unto him: howe he blamed those that woulde have kepte theym from hym, how he exhorted all men to folowe their innocencye. Ye perceive how by his outward gesture and dede he declared his good wil towarde them. For he embraced them in his armes, he laied his hands upon them, and blessed them, doubt not you therfore, but ernestly beleve that he wil likewise favourably receive these present infants, that he wil embrace the with the armes of his mercy, that he wil geve unto them the blessing of eternal life: and make them partakers of his everlasting kingdome. Wherfore we being thus perswaded of the good wyl of our heavenly father, towardes these enfants declared by his son Jesus Christ, and nothing doubting, but that he favourably alloweth this charitable woorke of ours, in bringing these children to his holye Baptisme: let us faithfully and devoutly geve thakes unto him, and saye

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we geve thee humble thankes, that thou haste vouchedsaufe to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and fayth in the, encrease this knowledge, and confirme this faith in us evermore: Geve thy holy spirit to these enfantes, that they may be borne againe, and be made heyres of everlasting salvacion, throughe our Lorde Jesus Christ. who liveth and reigneth with the, and the holy spirite, nowe and for ever. Amen.

Then the Priest shal speake unto the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this wyse:

WELBELOVED frendes, ye have broughte these children here to be baptised, ye have praied that our lord Jesus christ, would vouchesaufe to receive them, to lay his handes upon them, to blesse them, to release them of their sinnes, to geve theim the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting lyfe. Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised in his Gospel, to graunt all these thinges that ye have praied for: which promise he for his part wil most surely kepe and performe. Wherfore after this promise made by Christ, these infants muste also faythfully for their part promise by you that be their sureties, that they wil forsake the divil and al his woorkes, and constantly beleve Gods holy word, and obediently kepe his commaundements.

Then shal the Priest demaunde of the Godfathers and Godmothers thes questions.

DOEST thou forsake the devil and all his workes, the vaine pompe and glorye of the world, with al covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not folow, nor be led by them?

Aunswere. I forsake them al.

The Minister. Doest thou beleve in god the father almighty, maker of heave and earth? And in Jesus christ his only begotten sonne our Lord, and that he was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary: that he suifred under Poncius Pilate, was crucifyed, dead and buried, that he went doune into hel, and also did rise againe the thirde day: that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right had of god the father almighty; and from thence shall come againe at the ende of the worlde, to judge the quicke and the dead? And doest thou beleve in the holy Ghoste the holy Catholicque Churche, the communion of sainctes, the remission of synnes, the resurreccion of the fleshe, and everlasting lyfe after death?

Aunswere. All this I stedfastly beleve.

Ministre. Wylt thou be baptised in this fayth?

Aunswere. That is my desyre.



Marke x.

Â¶ Then shal the Priest say.

O MERCIFUL God, graunte that the olde Adam in these children maye be so buried, that the newe man may be raysed up in them. Amen.

Graunte that all carnal affeccions maye dye in them, and that all thinges belonginge to the spirite may live and growe in them. Amen.

Graunte that they may have power and strength to have victory, and to triumphe against the Divil, the worlde, and the flesh. Amen.

Graunt that whosoever is here dedicated to thee, by our office and ministerie, may also be endued with heavenly vertues, and everlastingly rewarded through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who doest live and govern al thinges worlde without ende. Amen.

ALMIGHTY everliving God, whose most derely beloved son Jesus Christe, for the forgevenes of our sinnes, did shed out his moste precious syde bothe water and bloude, and gave commaundement to his disciples that they should go teache al nacions, and baptise them in the name of the father, the sonne, and of the holy Ghost : Regard, we beseche the, the supplicacions of thy congregacion, and graunt that al thy servantes whiche shalbe baptised in this water, may receve the fulnes of thy grace, and ever remaine in the nombre of thy faithful and elect chyldren, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then the Priest shal take the Childe in his handes, and aske the name; and naming the Childe, shal dippe it in the water, so it be discretely and warely done, saying,

N. I Baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

Â¶ And yf the Ghilde be weake, it shall suffice to powre water upon it, saying the foresaid wordes.

N. I Baptize the in the name of the Father, and of the sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the Priest shall make a Crosse upon the Childes forehead, saying:

WE receive this Childe into the congregacion of Christes flocke, and do sygne him with the signe of the crosse, in token that hereafter he shal not be ashamed to confesse the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner against sinne, the worlde, and the devyll, and to continue Christes faithful souldiour and servaunt unto his lives ende. Amen.

Then shal the Priest say,

SEYING now, derely beloved brethren that these children be regenerate and graffed [grafted] into the bodye of Christes congregacion, let us geve thankes unto God for these benefites, and with one accorde make our praiours unto almighty God, that thei may lead the reste of their lyfe according to this beginning.

Then shal be sayd.

Our Father which art &c.

Then shal the Priest say,

We yelde the harty thankes most merciful father, that it hathe pleased thee to regenerate this enfant with thy holy spirite, to receyve him for thine owne childe by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy congregacion. And humbly we beseche thee to graunt that he being dead unto sinne and lyving unto righteousnes, and being buried with Christ in his death, maye crucify the old man, and utterly abolyshe the whole bodye of synne, that as he is made partaker of the deathe of thy sonne, so he maye be partaker of hys resurreccion, so that finally with the residue of thy holy congregacion, he may be inheritour of thine everlasting kingdome. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Â¶ At the laste ende, the Priest calling the Godfathers and Godmothers together, shal say this shorte exhortation folowing.

FORASMUCHE as these children have promysed by you to forsake the Devil and his woorkes, to beleve in God, and to serve hym, you must remember that it is your parts and duties to see that these enfants be taughte, so sone as they shalbe able to learne, what a solempne vowe, promyse, and profession they have made by you. And that they may know these thinges the better; ye shal cal upon theim to heare Sermons, And chiefly you shal provide that they may learne the Crede, the Lordes praier, and the Ten Commaundementes in the English tongue; and al other thinges which a Christian man ought to know and beleve to his soules health. And that these children may be vertuously brought up, to leade a Godly and a christian life, remembring alwaies that Baptisme doeth represent unto us our profession, which is to folow the example of our saviour Christ, and to be made like unto hym, that as he died and rose again for us: so should we (whiche are Baptised) dye from sinne, and ryse again unto rightuousnes, continually mortifiyng al our evyll and corrupt affections, and dailye procedynge in all vertue and godlynes of living.

Â¶	The Minister shal commaunde that the chyldren be brought to the Byshop to be confyrmed of him, so sone as they can saye in theyr vulgare tongue the articles of the faythe, the Lordes praier, and the x. Commaundementes, and be further instructed in the Catechisme set furth for that purpose, accordyngly as it is there expressed.





OF THEM THAT BE

BAPTISED IN PRIVATE HOUSES,

IN TYME OF NECESSITIE.

[BY THE LAWFUL MINISTER OF THE PARISH, OR ANY OTHER LAWFUL MINISTER, THAT CAN BE PROCURED.]*



* Added in 1604.





Â¶	The Pastours and Curates shal oft admonish the people, that they deferre not the Baptisme of enfantes any longer then the Sonday, or other holy day, next after the childe be borne unlesse upon a great and reasonable cause declared to the Curate, and by him approved.



1559:

And also they shal warne theim that without great cause, and necessity, they baptize not children at home in their houses. And when great nede shall compelle theim so to doe, that then they minister on this fassion.

Fyrste let theim that be present cal upon God for hys grace, and say the Lordes prayour, yf the time wil sufre. And then one of them shall name the childe, and dippe him in the water, or powre water upon him, saying these wordes.

1604:

And also they shall warne them, that without great cause and necessity, they procure not their children to be baptized at home in their houses. And when great need shall compel them so to do, that then Baptisme shall be administered in this fashion.

First, let the lawfull Minister, and them that be present, call upon God for his grace and say the Lord's Prayer, if the time will suffer. And then the childe being named by some one that is present, the said lawfull Minister shall dip it in water, or poure water upon it, saying these words.





N. I Baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoste. Amen.

And let them not doubte, but that the childe so Baptised, is lawfully and sufficiently Baptised, and ought not to be Baptised agayne in the Church. But yet neverthles, if the child whyche is after this sorte Baptised, do afterwarde live, it is expediente that he be broughte into the Churche, to the entent the Priest may examyne and trie, whether the child be lawfully Baptised or no. And yf those that bryng any childe to the Churche do answere that he is already Baptised: then shal the Priest examine them further.





N. I Baptise thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

And let them not doubte, but that the childe so Baptised, is lawfully and sufficiently Baptised, and ought not to be Baptised agayne in the Church. But yet neverthles, if the child whyche is after this sorte Baptised, do afterwarde live, it is expediente that he be broughte into the Churche, to the entent that if the Priest or Minister of the same Parish did himself baptize that childe, the Congregation may be certified of the true forme of Baptisme, by him privately before used: Or if the child were baptized by any other lawfull Minister, that then the Minister of the Parish where the childe was borne or Christened, shall examine and trie whether this childe be lawfully baptized, or no. In which case, if those that bring any childe to the Church, do answer that the same child is already baptized, then shall the Minister examine them further, saying,





Â¶ By whome the childe was Baptised?

Â¶ Who was present when the childe was Baptised?

Â¶ Whether they called upon God for grace and succour in that necessitie?

Â¶ Wyth what thing, or what matter they did Baptyse the Chylde?

Â¶ Wyth what wordes the childe was Baptised?

Â¶ Whether they thinke the childe to be lawfully and perfectly Baptised?

Â¶ By whom the childe was baptized?

Â¶ Who was present when the childe was baptized?

Â¶ And because some things essentiall to this Sacrament may happen to be omitted through fear or haste in such times of extremitie; therefore I demand further of you,

Â¶ With what matter was the childe baptized?

Â¶ With what words was the childe baptized?

Â¶ Whether think you the childe to bee lawfully and perfectly baptized?





Â¶	And yf the Minister shall prove* by the aunswers of suche, as brought* the childe, that all thinges were done as they oughte to be: Then shal not he Christen the childe againe, but shall receyve him, as one of the flocke of the true Christian people, saiynge thus.

I CERTIFY you, that in this case ye have done wel*, and according unto due ordre concerning the Baptising of this childe, whiche beyng borne in Originall sinne and in the wrathe of God, is nowe by the laver [=water] of regeneracion in Baptisme, received into the nomber of the children of God, and heires of everlasting life, for our Lorde Jesus Christ doeth not deny his grace and mercy unto such infantes, but most lovingly doth cal the unto him: as the holy gospel doth witnes to our comfort on this wise.

* "all is well done" in 1604.



AT a certaine time they brought children unto Christ that he should touche them, and his dysciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said unto them: Suffre litle children to come unto me, and forbid theim not, for to such belongeth the kingdome of God. Verely I say unto you, whosoever doth not receive the kingdom of God as a litle child, he shal not entre therin. And when he had taken them up in his armes, he put his handes upon them, and blessed them.

Â¶ After the Gospel is redde, the minister shal make this exhortacion upon the wordes of the Gospel.

FRENDES, ye heare in this Gospell the wordes of oure saviour Christe, that he commaunded the chyldren to bee brought unto hym: howe he blamed those that woulde have kepte theym from him, howe he exhorted all men to folowe their innocencye: Ye perceive how by his outward gesture in dede he declared his good wil toward them. For he embraced them in his armes, he laied his hands upon them, and blessed them, doubt not you therefore, but earnestly beleve, that he hath likewise fauourably received this present infant, that he hathe embraced hym wyth the armes of hys mercy, that he hath geven unto him the blessing of eternal life, and made him partaker of his everlasting kingdom. Wherfore we beyng thus perswaded of the good wil of our heevenly father declared by his sonne Jesus Christ towards this infant, Let us faithfully and devoutly geve thankes unto him, and say the praier, which the lord him self taught, and in declaracion of our faith, let us recite the articles conteined in our Crede.

Â¶ Here the Minister with the Godfathers, and Godmothers shall say.

OUR Father which &c.

Â¶	Then the Priest shal demand the name of the child, which beyng by the Godfathers, and Godmothers pronounced, the Minister shall say,

Â¶ DOEST thou in the name of this child forsfake the devil, and al his workes, the vaine pompe, and glory of the world, with al the covetous desires of the same, the carnal desires of the fleshe, and not to folowe and be ledde by them?

Aunswere. I forsake them al.

Â¶ The Minister. Doest thou in the name of this childe professe this faith, to beleve in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth And in Jesus Christ his only begotten son our Lord, and that he was conceived by the holy ghost, borne of the virgin Mary: that he suffered under ponce Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried, that he wet doune into hel, and also did rise again the iii daye: that he ascended into heaven, and sytteth at the ryght hande of God the father almightye: and from thence he shal come again at the ende of the world, to judge the quicke and the dead? And do you in his name beleve in the holy gost the holy Catholicque church, the communion of sainctes, the remission of sinnes, resurreccion of the fleshe, and everlasting life after death?

Aunswere. All this I steadfastly beleve.

Let us pray.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, heavenly father, we geve thee humble thanckes, for that thou hast vouchedsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faythe in thee: increase this knowledge, and confyrme this faythe in us evermore: Geve thy holye spirite to this infante,that he beynge borne agayne and beynge made heyre of everlastynge salvacion, through our Lord Jesus Christ, may continue thy servant, and atteine thy promise, through the same our Lorde Jesus Christ thy sonne, who liveth and reigneth with the in the unitie of the same holy spirit everlasting. Amen.

Then shal the Minister make this exhortacion, to the Godfathers and Godmothers.

FORASMUCHE as this childe hath promised by you to forsake the devil and al his workes, to beleve in God, and to serve him: you must remembre that it is your part and dutie, to see that this enfante be taught (so sone as he shalbe able to learne) what a solempne vowe promise, and profession he hath made by you. And that he may know these thinges the better, ye shal call upon him to hear sermons. And chiefly ye shal provide that he may learne the Crede, the Lordes praier and the x Commaundementes in the English tongue, and al other thinges which a Christian man ought to know, and beleve to his soules health, and that this chyld may be vertuously brought up, to leade a godly, and a christian lyfe. Remembring alway that Baptisme doeth represent unto us our profession, which is to folow the example of our Saviour Christ, and be made like unto him, that as he died and rose againe for us, so shoulde we which are Baptized, dye from sinne, and rise againe unto righteousnes, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceding in al vertue, and godlines of living, etc:

Â¶ As in Publique Baptisme.

Â¶	But if they which bring the enfantes to the Church, do make an uncerteine aunswere* to the Priestes questions, and say that they cannot tel what they thought, didde, or said, in yt great feare, and trouble of minde: (as ofte times it chaunseth) then let the Priest Baptise him in forme above written, concerning publique Baptisme, saving that at the dipping of the chylde in the Fonte, he shal use this forme af wordes.

If thou be not Baptized al ready, N. I baptise the in the name of the father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoste. Amen.

THE ORDER FOR THE

BURIALL OF THE DEAD.

Â¶	The prieste metyng the corpse at the Church style, shal saye, Or els the priestes and clerkes shall syng, and so go eyther unto* the churche, or towardes the grave.



* "into" in 1604.



	I AM the resurrection and the life (saith the Lord) he that beleveth in me: yea, thoughe he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall not dye for ever.





Jhon xi.

I KNOWE that my redemer lyveth, and that I shal rise out of the earth in the last daye, and shal be covered agayne with my skinne, and shall se God in my flesh: yea, and I my selfe shall beholde hym, not with other, but with thesame eyes.





Job xix.

	WE brought nothinge into this worlde, neither may we cary any thyng out of this worlde.



i. Tim. vi.

	 The Lord geveth, and the Lorde taketh awaye. Even as it hath pleased the Lorde so commeth thynges to passe: Blessed be the name of the Lorde.

Â¶	When they come to the grave, whyles the corps is made redy to be layd into the earth, ye priest shal say, or the priestes, and clerkes shal sing.



Job i.

	MAN that is borne of a woman hathe but a shorte tyme to lyve, and is full of miserye: he commeth up, and is cut doune lyke a floure, he flyeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one staye. In the middest of life we be in death, of whom mai we seke for succour but of the, O Lorde, whiche for our sinnes justly arte displeased: yet O Lorde God most holy, O Lorde moste mightye, O holy, and moste mercifull Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter paynes of eternall death. Thou knowest Lord the secretes of our hertes, shut not up thy mercifull eyes to our prayers. But spare us Lorde moste holy, O God moste mighty, O holy and mercifull Saviour, thou most worthy judge eternall, suffer us not at our last houre for any paines of death to fall from the.

Â¶ Then whyle the earth shal be cast upon the body by some standing by, the priest shall saye.

FOR asmuche as it hath pleased almightie God of his great mercy to take unto hym selfe the Soule of oure deare brother, here departed, we therfore committe hys bodye to the grounde, earthe, to earthe ashes, to ashes, dust, to dust, in sure, and certein hope of resurrection to eternall lyfe, throughe oure Lorde Jesus Christe, who shall change oure vyle body that it may be lyke to his glorious body, according to the mighty workynge whereby he is able to subdue al thynges to hym selfe.

Then shalbe sayde, or songe.

I HEARDE a voyce from heaven saiyng unto me, wryte from hencefurth, blessed are the dead whiche dye in the Lorde. Even so sayeth the spirite that they reste from their labours.



Job xi.

Then shall folowe this lesson, taken out of the . xv. Chap. to the Corin. the first Epistle.

CHRIST is rysen from the dead, and become the fyrst frutes of them that slept. For by a man came deth, and by a man came the resurreccion of the dead. For as by Adam al die, even so by Christ shal al be made alive, but every manne in his owne order. The fyrste is Christe, then they that are Christes at his comming. Then commeth the ende when he hathe delivered up the kyngedome to God the father, when he hath put doune all rule, and all aucthoritie and power. For he must reygne till he have put hys enemies under hys fete. The laste enemye that shalbe destroyed is deathe. For he hath putte all thynges under his feete. But when he sayeth, all thynges are putte under hym, it is manifeste that hee is excepted, whyche dyd putte all thynges under hym. When al thinges are subdued unto him, then shall the sonne also hym self be subjecte unto him that put all thynges under hym, that God maye be al in all, elles what do they whyche are baptised over the deade, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptised over them: yea, and why stande we alway then in jeopardye? By our rejoysinge which I have in Christ jesu our Lorde, I dye daily. That I have foughte wyth beastes Ephesus after the maner of men, what avauntageth it me, if the dead ryse not agayne? Lette us eate and drincke, for to morow we shall dye. Be not ye deceyved; evil wordes corrupt good maners. Awake truly out of slepe, and sinne not. For somme have not the knowledge of God. I speake this to your shame. But some manne wyl say how aryse the dead? with what body shal they come? thou foole, that whiche thou sowest is not quickened except it dye. And what sowest thou? thou sowest not that body that shalbe; but bare corne [=seed], as of wheate, or some other: but God geveth it a bodye at hys plesure, to everye sede his owne bodye. All fleshe is not one maner of flesh: but there is one maner of flesh of menne, an other maner of flesh of beasts, an other of fishes, an other of byrdes. There are also celestial bodyes, and there are bodies terrestriall. But the glory of the celestiall is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one maner glory of the Sonne, and another glory of the Mone [Moon], and another glory of the starres. For one starre differeth from another in glory: so is the resurrection of the deade. It is sowen in corrupcion, it riseth againe in incorrupcion. It is sowen in dishonoure, it riseth againe in honoure. It is sowen in weaknes, it ryseth againe in power. It is sowen a natural body, it ryseth againe a spirituall bodye. There is a natural body, and there is a spirituall body: as it is also wryten, the fyrst man Adam was made a lyvynge soule, and the laste Adam was made a quickeninge spirite. How be it that is not fyrst whyche is spirituall: but that whiche is naturall and then that whiche is spirytual. The first man is of the earth, earthye : The seconde manne is the Lord from Heaven (heavenlye). As is the earthy, suche are they that be earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly. And as we have borne the ymage of the earthye, so shall we beare the ymage of the heavenly. Thys saye I brethren, that fleshe and bloude cannot enherite the kyngdome of God, neyther doth corruption enherite incorruption. Beholde, I shewe you a mystery. we shall not all slepe: but we shall al be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twynkelynge of an eye by the last trumpe [trumpet]. For the trumpe shall blowe, and the deade shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be chaunged. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortall must put on immortalitye. When this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitye: then shall be broughte to passe the sayinge that is wrytten, Deathe is swallowed up in victory: Deathe, where is thy stinge? Hell where is thy victory? The stynge of deathe is sinne, and the strengthe of sinne is the lawe. But thankes be unto God, whyche hathe geven us victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therfore my deare brethren, be ye stedfast and unmovable, alwaies rich in the worke of the lorde, forasmuch as ye knowe, howe that your laboure is not in vayne in the Lorde.

Â¶ The Lesson ended, the Priest shall saye.

Lorde have mercye upon us.

Christe have mercye upon us.

Lorde have mercye upon us.

Our Father whiche arte in heaven. &c.

And leade us not into temptacion.

Aunswere. But deliver us from evil. Amen.



Â¶ The Priest.

ALMIGHTIE God, with whome do live the spirites of them that depart hence in the lorde and in whome the soules of them that be elected, after they be delivered from the burthen of the flesh, be in joye and felicitie. We geve the hearty thankes for that it hath pleased the to deliver this N. oure brother, out of the miseries of thys synneful worlde beseching the that it may please the of thy gracious goodnes, shortelye to accomplishe the numbre of thyne electe, and to haste thy kyngedome, that we with thys oure brother, and all other departed in the true fayth of thy holy name, may have our perfect consummacion and blisse, both in bodye and soule in thy eternall and everlastynge glorie. Amen.

Â¶ The Collect.

O MERCIFULL God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christe, who is the Resurrection and the lyfe, in whom whosoever beleveth shall live, thoughe he dye, and whosoever liveth, and beleveth in hym, shall not dye eternally, who also taughte us (by hys holy apostle Paule), not to be sory as men without hope, for them that slepe in hym: We mekely beseche the (O Father) to rayse us from the deathe of sinne unto the lyfe of righteousnes, that when we shall depart thys lyfe, we may rest in hym, as our hope is thys oure brother doeth, and that at the generall resurrection in the laste daye, we maye be founde acceptable in thy syghte, and receive that blessing which thy welbeloved sonne shall then pronounce to all that love and fear the, saiynge: Come ye blessed children of my father, receyve the Kyngedome prepared for you frome the begynnynge of the worlde. Graunte thys, we beseche the, O mercifull father, throughe Jesus Christe our mediatoure and redemer. Amen.

A COMMINATION AGAINST SINNERS,

WITH CERTAINE PRAYERS, TO BE USED DIVERS TIMES IN THE YERE.



After Mornyng prayer, the people beyng called together by the ringyng of a Bel, and assembled in the Churche, thenglish Letany shalbe saide after thaccustomed maner, whyche ended the priest shal go into the pulpit and saie thus.

BRETHREN, in the Prymatyve churche there was a godly discipline, that at the beginyng of Lent, suche personnes as were notoryus Synners, were putte to open penaunce and punyshed in thys world, that their soules might be saved in the daie of the lord. And that others admonyshed by theyr example myght be more afrayde to offende. In the stede wherof (untill the sayde Discypline maye be restored agayne, whyche thynge is muche to be wyshed) it is thought good that at this time (in your presence) shoulde be redde the general sentences of goddes cursyng agaynst impenitent Synners, gathered out of the .xxvii. Chapiter of Deuteronomye, and other places of Scripture. And that ye shoulde aunswere to every sentence. Amen. To thyntent that you being admonished of the great indignation of God against Synners: may the rather be called to earnest and true repentaunce, and maye walke more warely in these daungerous daies, flieing from suche vices, for the whyche ye affirme wyth your owne mouthes, the Curse of God to be due.

CURSED is the man that maketh any carved, or molten Image, an abhomination to the Lorde, the worke of the handes of the craftes man, and putteth it in a secrete place to worship it.

Â¶ And the people shal aunswere and saie

Amen.

Aunswere. Amen.

Nowe seyng that all they be accursed (as the Prophete David beareth wytnesse) [Psa. cxviii. =Ps. 119:21] whyche do erre, and go astraye from the cornmaundernentes of God, let us remembring the dreadful judgemente hanginge over our heddes, and beyng always at hande returne unto oure Lorde God, with all contricion and mekenes of hearte, bewailynge and lamenting our synful lyfe, knowledging [=acknowledging] and confessing our offences, and sekynge to brynge furth worthie fruictes of penaunce. For nowe is the Axe put unto the roote of the trees, so that every tree which bringeth not furth good fruict, is hewen downe and cast into the fire. [Math. iii.] It is a fearfull thing to falle into the handes of the lyvinge God: [Heb. x.] he shal poure doune raine upon the synners, Snares, fyre, and brimstone, storme and tempeste, thys shalbe their portion to drincke.[Psal. x. = Ps. 11:6] For lo, the Lorde is comen out of his place, to visite the wickednesse of suche as dwel upon the earth. [Esai. (Isaiah) xxvi.] But who may abyde the daye of his comming? Who shalbe able to endure, when he apereth? [Mal. iii.] His fanne is in his hande, and he wyll pourge hys floore, and gather his wheate into the barne, but he wyl burne the chaffe with unquenchable fyre. [Math. iii.] The daye of the Lord commeth as a thefe upon the night, and when men shall saye peace, and all thinges are saufe, then shal soubdenly destruction come upon them, as sorowe commeth uppon a woman travailyng with childe, and they shall not escape. [i. Thes. v.] Then shall appeare the wrathe of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, throughe the stubburnnes of theyr hearte, have heaped unto them selfe, [Rom. ii.] whyche despysed the goodnes, pacyence, and longe sufferaunce of God, when he called them continually to repentaunce. Then shall they call upon me, sayeth the Lorde, but I wyll not heare: they shall seke me early, but they shall not fynde me: and that because they hated knowledge, and receyved not the feare of the Lorde, but abhorred my counsail, and dispised my correcyon, [Prover. i.] then shall it be to late to knocke, when the dore shalbe shutte, and to late to crye for mercye, when it is the tyrne of Justice. O terryble voyce of most just judgement, whiche shalbe 	pronounced upon them, when it shalbe sayde unto them: Go, ye cursed, into the fyre everlastynge, whyche is prepared for the devill 	and hys Aungeles. [Mat. xxv.] Therfore brethren take we hede by tyme, [betime, =in good time] whyle the daie of salvacion lasteth, [ii. Cor. vi.] for the nyght commeth when none can 	worke: [Jhon ix.] but let us whyle we have the lyght, beleve in the lyghte, and walke as the children of the lyght, that we be not caste into the 	utter darckenes, where is wepyinge and gnasshynge of teeth. [Mat. xxv.] Lette us not abuse the goodnes of God, whyche calleth us mercyfully to amendement, and of hys endelesse pytye promysed us forgevenesse of that whyche is paste [past]: If (wyth a whole mynde and true hearte) 	we returne unto hym. For though our synnes be red as scarlet, they shalbe as whyte as snowe, and thoughe they be lyke purple, 	yet shall they be as whyte as wolle. [Esay. (Isaiah) i.] Turne you cleane (sayeth the Lorde) from all your wickednes, and your synne shal not be your destruction. [Ezechiel xxviii. =Ezek. 18] Cast awaye from you all your ungodlynes that ye have done: make you newe heartes, and a newe spiryte: wherfore wyll ye dye, O ye house of Israell? Seiyng that I have no pleasure in the deathe of hym that dyeth (sayeth the Lorde God.) Turne you then, and you shall lyve. Although we have synned, yet have we an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christe the ryghteous, and he it 	is that obteyneth grace for our synnes, [i. Jhon ii.] for he was wounded for our offences, and smytten for our wyckednesse. [Esai. liii.] Let us therfore returne unto hym, who is the mercifull receyver of all true penitent sinners, assuring oure selfe that he is ready to receyve us, and most willyng to pardone us, yf we come to him, with faythfull repentaunce. Yf we will submit our selves unto him, and from hencefurthe walke in his wayes. Yf we will take hys easy yoke, and lighte burthen upon us, [Math. xi.] to folowe hym in lowlines, pacience, and charitie, and be ordered by the governaunce of hys holy spirite, seking alwayes his glorie, and servyng hym duely in our vocation with thankes gevynge. This yf we do, Christ wil deliver us from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction, which light upon theym, that shalbe set 	on the left hand, and he wyll set us on hys ryght hande, and geve us the blessed benediction of hys father, commaundynge us to take possession of his gloryous kyngdome, [Math. xxv.] unto the whiche he vouchesaufe to brynge us al, for hys infinite mercye.

Â¶	Then shall they all knele upon theyr knees: And the Priestes and Clerckes knelynge (were they are accustomed to saye the Letany) shall say thy: Psalme. Miserere mei Deus.





The scripture references seen here within the text were placed in the margin in the original.



HAVE mercy upon me, O God after thy great goodnes, according to the multitud of thy mercyes, do away myne offences,

Washe me throughly from my wyckednes and clense me from my synne.

For I acknowledge my faultes, and my synne is ever before me.

Against the onely have I synned, and done this evyll in thy sight, that thou mightest be justyfyed in thy sayeng, and cleare when thou art judged.

Beholde, I was shapen in wickednesse, and in synne hath my mother conceived me.

But lo, thou requirest trueth in inwarde parties [parts], and shalt make me to understande wisedome secretlye.

Thou shalte purge me with hysoppe, and I shall be cleane, thou shalt washe me, and I shall be whyter then Snowe.

Thou shalt make me here of joy and gladnesse : that the bones whiche thou hast broken may rejoyce.

Turne thy face from my sinnes: and put oute all my misdedes.

Make me a cleane hearte (O God:) and renue a right spirite within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence : and take not thy holy spirite from me.

O geve me the comforte of thy helpe agayne: and stablysh me with thy free spirite.

Then shall I teache thy wayes unto the wicked : and sinners shalbe converted unto the.

Deliver me from bloude giltines (O God) thou that art the God of my healthe: and my tonge shall synge of thy ryghteousnes.

Thou shalte open my lyppes (O Lord) my mouth shal shewe thy prayse.

For thou desirest no sacrifice, els woulde I geve it the: but thou delightest not in burnt offerynge.

The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirite: a broken and a contrite hearte O God, shalte thou not despise.

O be favourable and gracious unto Sion : builde thou the walles of Jerusalem.

Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of rightuousnesse, with the burnt offerynges and oblations : then shall they offer yong bullockes upon thine aultare.

O LORD, we beseche the, mercifully heare our prayers, and spare al those which confesse their sinnes to the, that they (whose consciences by sin are accused) by thy merciful pardon may be absolved, throughe Christ our Lorde. Amen.

O MOSTE mighty God, and mercyfull father which haste compassion of al men, and hatest nothing that thou haste made: whiche wouldest not the deathe of a synner, but that he should rather turne from synne, and be saved: mercifully forgeve us oure trespasses, and comforte us, whiche be grieved and weryed [wearied] with the burden of oure synne.

After Mornyng prayer, the people beyng called together by the ringyng of a Bel, and assembled in the Churche, thenglish Letany shalbe saide after thaccustomed maner, whyche ended the priest shal go into the pulpit and saie thus.

BRETHREN, in the Prymatyve churche there was a godly discipline, that at the beginyng of Lent, suche personnes as were notoryus Synners, were putte to open penaunce and punyshed in thys world, that their soules might be saved in the daie of the lord. And that others admonyshed by theyr example myght be more afrayde to offende. In the stede wherof (untill the sayde Discypline maye be restored agayne, whyche thynge is muche to be wyshed) it is thought good that at this time (in your presence) shoulde be redde the general sentences of goddes cursyng agaynst impenitent Synners, gathered out of the .xxvii. Chapiter of Deuteronomye, and other places of Scripture. And that ye shoulde aunswere to every sentence. Amen. To thyntent that you being admonished of the great indignation of God against Synners: may the rather be called to earnest and true repentaunce, and maye walke more warely in these daungerous daies, flieing from suche vices, for the whyche ye affirme wyth your owne mouthes, the Curse of God to be due.

CURSED is the man that maketh any carved, or molten Image, an abhomination to the Lorde, the worke of the handes of the craftes man, and putteth it in a secrete place to worship it.

Â¶ And the people shal aunswere and saie

Amen.

Aunswere. Amen.

Aunswere. Amen.

Aunswere. Amen.

The Minister.





Nowe seyng that all they be accursed (as the Prophete David beareth wytnesse) [Psa. cxviii. =Ps. 119:21] whyche do erre, and go astraye from the cornmaundernentes of God, let us remembring the dreadful judgemente hanginge over our heddes, and beyng always at hande returne unto oure Lorde God, with all contricion and mekenes of hearte, bewailynge and lamenting our synful lyfe, knowledging [=acknowledging] and confessing our offences, and sekynge to brynge furth worthie fruictes of penaunce. For nowe is the Axe put unto the roote of the trees, so that every tree which bringeth not furth good fruict, is hewen downe and cast into the fire. [Math. iii.] It is a fearfull thing to falle into the handes of the lyvinge God: [Heb. x.] he shal poure doune raine upon the synners, Snares, fyre, and brimstone, storme and tempeste, thys shalbe their portion to drincke.[Psal. x. = Ps. 11:6] For lo, the Lorde is comen out of his place, to visite the wickednesse of suche as dwel upon the earth. [Esai. (Isaiah) xxvi.] But who may abyde the daye of his comming? Who shalbe able to endure, when he apereth? [Mal. iii.] His fanne is in his hande, and he wyll pourge hys floore, and gather his wheate into the barne, but he wyl burne the chaffe with unquenchable fyre. [Math. iii.] The daye of the Lord commeth as a thefe upon the night, and when men shall saye peace, and all thinges are saufe, then shal soubdenly destruction come upon them, as sorowe commeth uppon a woman travailyng with childe, and they shall not escape. [i. Thes. v.] Then shall appeare the wrathe of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, throughe the stubburnnes of theyr hearte, have heaped unto them selfe, [Rom. ii.] whyche despysed the goodnes, pacyence, and longe sufferaunce of God, when he called them continually to repentaunce. Then shall they call upon me, sayeth the Lorde, but I wyll not heare: they shall seke me early, but they shall not fynde me: and that because they hated knowledge, and receyved not the feare of the Lorde, but abhorred my counsail, and dispised my correcyon, [Prover. i.] then shall it be to late to knocke, when the dore shalbe shutte, and to late to crye for mercye, when it is the tyrne of Justice. O terryble voyce of most just judgement, whiche shalbe 	pronounced upon them, when it shalbe sayde unto them: Go, ye cursed, into the fyre everlastynge, whyche is prepared for the devill 	and hys Aungeles. [Mat. xxv.] Therfore brethren take we hede by tyme, [betime, =in good time] whyle the daie of salvacion lasteth, [ii. Cor. vi.] for the nyght commeth when none can 	worke: [Jhon ix.] but let us whyle we have the lyght, beleve in the lyghte, and walke as the children of the lyght, that we be not caste into the 	utter darckenes, where is wepyinge and gnasshynge of teeth. [Mat. xxv.] Lette us not abuse the goodnes of God, whyche calleth us mercyfully to amendement, and of hys endelesse pytye promysed us forgevenesse of that whyche is paste [past]: If (wyth a whole mynde and true hearte) 	we returne unto hym. For though our synnes be red as scarlet, they shalbe as whyte as snowe, and thoughe they be lyke purple, 	yet shall they be as whyte as wolle. [Esay. (Isaiah) i.] Turne you cleane (sayeth the Lorde) from all your wickednes, and your synne shal not be your destruction. [Ezechiel xxviii. =Ezek. 18] Cast awaye from you all your ungodlynes that ye have done: make you newe heartes, and a newe spiryte: wherfore wyll ye dye, O ye house of Israell? Seiyng that I have no pleasure in the deathe of hym that dyeth (sayeth the Lorde God.) Turne you then, and you shall lyve. Although we have synned, yet have we an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christe the ryghteous, and he it 	is that obteyneth grace for our synnes, [i. Jhon ii.] for he was wounded for our offences, and smytten for our wyckednesse. [Esai. liii.] Let us therfore returne unto hym, who is the mercifull receyver of all true penitent sinners, assuring oure selfe that he is ready to receyve us, and most willyng to pardone us, yf we come to him, with faythfull repentaunce. Yf we will submit our selves unto him, and from hencefurthe walke in his wayes. Yf we will take hys easy yoke, and lighte burthen upon us, [Math. xi.] to folowe hym in lowlines, pacience, and charitie, and be ordered by the governaunce of hys holy spirite, seking alwayes his glorie, and servyng hym duely in our vocation with thankes gevynge. This yf we do, Christ wil deliver us from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction, which light upon theym, that shalbe set 	on the left hand, and he wyll set us on hys ryght hande, and geve us the blessed benediction of hys father, commaundynge us to take possession of his gloryous kyngdome, [Math. xxv.] unto the whiche he vouchesaufe to brynge us al, for hys infinite mercye.

Â¶	Then shall they all knele upon theyr knees: And the Priestes and Clerckes knelynge (were they are accustomed to saye the Letany) shall say thy: Psalme. Miserere mei Deus.





The scripture references seen here within the text were placed in the margin in the original.



HAVE mercy upon me, O God after thy great goodnes, according to the multitud of thy mercyes, do away myne offences,

Washe me throughly from my wyckednes and clense me from my synne.

For I acknowledge my faultes, and my synne is ever before me.

Against the onely have I synned, and done this evyll in thy sight, that thou mightest be justyfyed in thy sayeng, and cleare when thou art judged.

Beholde, I was shapen in wickednesse, and in synne hath my mother conceived me.

But lo, thou requirest trueth in inwarde parties [parts], and shalt make me to understande wisedome secretlye.

Thou shalte purge me with hysoppe, and I shall be cleane, thou shalt washe me, and I shall be whyter then Snowe.

Thou shalt make me here of joy and gladnesse : that the bones whiche thou hast broken may rejoyce.

Turne thy face from my sinnes: and put oute all my misdedes.

Make me a cleane hearte (O God:) and renue a right spirite within me.

Cast me not away from thy presence : and take not thy holy spirite from me.

O geve me the comforte of thy helpe agayne: and stablysh me with thy free spirite.

Then shall I teache thy wayes unto the wicked : and sinners shalbe converted unto the.

Deliver me from bloude giltines (O God) thou that art the God of my healthe: and my tonge shall synge of thy ryghteousnes.

Thou shalte open my lyppes (O Lord) my mouth shal shewe thy prayse.

For thou desirest no sacrifice, els woulde I geve it the: but thou delightest not in burnt offerynge.

The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirite: a broken and a contrite hearte O God, shalte thou not despise.

O be favourable and gracious unto Sion : builde thou the walles of Jerusalem.

Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of rightuousnesse, with the burnt offerynges and oblations : then shall they offer yong bullockes upon thine aultare.

Glory bee to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghoste.

As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and ever shal be world without ende. Amen.

Lorde have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lorde have mercy upon us.

And leade us not into temptacion.

Aunswere. And for the glorye of thy names sake deliver us, bee mercyfull unto us synners, for thy names sake.

The Minister. Lorde heare my praiers.

Aunswere. And let our crie come unto thee.

Let us praye.

O LORD, we beseche the, mercifully heare our prayers, and spare al those which confesse their sinnes to the, that they (whose consciences by sin are accused) by thy merciful pardon may be absolved, throughe Christ our Lorde. Amen.

O MOSTE mighty God, and mercyfull father which haste compassion of al men, and hatest nothing that thou haste made: whiche wouldest not the deathe of a synner, but that he should rather turne from synne, and be saved: mercifully forgeve us oure trespasses, and comforte us, whiche be grieved and weryed [wearied] with the burden of oure synne. Thy propertye is to have mercy, to the onlye it apperteineth to forgeve synnes: spare us therefore good Lorde, spare thy people whom thou haste redemed. Enter not into judgement wyth thy servauntes, whiche be vyle earthe, and miserable synners, but so turne thyne yre [ire] from us whyche mekely knowledge [=acknowledge] oure vylenes, and trulye repente us of our faultes: so make haste to helpe us in this worlde, that we maye ever live wyth thee in the worlde to come, throughe Jesus Christe oure Lorde.

So many as entend to be partakers of the holy Communion, shall signifie their names to the Curate over night; or els in the mornyng, afore the beginning of morning prayer or immediately after.

And if any of those be an open and notorious evil liver, so that ye congregacion by him is offended, or have done any wrong to hys neighbours by word or dede ye curate havyng knowledge therof, shal cal hym, and advertyse hym, in any wise not to presume to the Lordes table, until he have openly declared him self to have truely repented, and amended his former naughty lyfe, that the Congregacion may therby be satisfyed, which afore were offended, and that he have recompensed the parties, who he hath done wrong unto, or at the least declare him selfe to be in full purpose so to doe, as sane as he conveniently may.

Thesame order shall the Curate use with those, betwixt whome he perceyveth malice and hatred to raigne not suffering them to be partakers of the Lordes table untyll he know them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties so at variance, he content to forgeve from the bottome of hys hart, all that the other hath trespassed agaynste him, and to make amends for that he hymn self hath offended: and the other partye wyll not be perswaded to a godly unitye, but remain stil in his frowardnes and malice The Minister in that case, ought to admit the penitent person to the holy Communyon, and not hym that is obstinate

Minister. Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven ymage, nor the likenes of any thyng that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneth, or in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow doune to them, nor worshyppe the, for I the Lord thy God am a gelous God, and visite the synne of the fathers uppon the children, unto the thyrde and iiii. generacyon of them that hate me, and shew rnercie unto thousandes in theim that love me, and keepe my commaundementes.

In it thou shalt do no maner of worke, thou and thy sonne and thy daughter, thy man servaunt, and thy mayd servaunt, thy Catel, and the straunger that is within thy gates: For in .vi. daies the Lord made heaven and earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and reasted the seventh daye. Wherefore the Lorde blessed the seventh daye and halowed it.

People. Lorde have mercy upon us, and encline our. &c.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and write al these thy lawes in our hartes we beseche the.

Â¶ Then shall folowe the Collect of the day with one of these two Collectes folawyng for the Quene, the Priest standyng up and saying.





Let us praye Priest.

ALMIGHTY God, whose kyngdom is everlasting, and power infinite, have mercy upon the whole congregacion, and so rule the heart of thy chose servant Elizabeth our Quene and governoure that she (knowing whose minister she is) may above all thinges, seke thy honoure and glorye: and that we her subjectes, (duly considering whose aucthority she hath) may faithfully serve, honour, and humblye obey her in the and for the, according to thy blessed worde, and ordinance, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with the and the holye ghost, lyveth and reygneth ever one God, worlde without ende. Amen.

ALMIGHTY and everlastinge God, we be taughte by thy holy word, that the hartes of Princes are in thy rule and governauce, and that thou doest dispose, and turne them as it semeth best to thy Godly wysedome: we humbly beseche thee, so to dispose and governe the harte of Elizabeth, thy servaunte, our Quene and governour, that in all her thoughtes, wordes, and workes she may ever seke thy honoure and glorye, and studye to preserve thy people committed to her charge, in welth, peace and godlynes. Graunt this O merciful father, for thy deare sonnes sake Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

Immediately after the Collectes, the Priest shall reade the Epystle beginning thus.

The Epystle written in the. Chapiter of.

And the Epystie ended, he shal say the Gospel, beginninge thus.

The Gospell wrytten in the. Chapiter of.

And the Epistle and Gospel being ended, shalbe said the Crede.

I BELEVE in one God, the father almighty maker of heaven and earthe, and of all thynges visible and invisible: And in one Lorde Jesu Christe, the onely begotten sonne of GOD, begotten of his father before al worldes, god of God, lyghte of lyghte, verye God of verye God, gotten, not made, beynge of one substance wyth the father, by whome all thinges were made, who for us men, and for our salvacion came doune from heaven, and was incarnate by the holy Ghoste, of the Virgine Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us, under poncius Pilate. He suffered and was buried, and the thyrde day he rose againe accordinge to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hande of the father. And he shal come againe with glory, to judge both the quicke and the deade, whose Kyngdome shall have none ende. And I beleve in the holye Ghoste, The Lorde and gever of life, who procedeth from the father and the sonne, who with the father and the sonne together is worshipped and glorified who spake by the Prophetes. And I beleve one catholicke and Apostolicke Churche. I acknowledge one Baptisme, for the remission of synnes. And I loke for the resurreccion of the dead : and the lyfe of the worlde to come. Amen.

After the Crede yf there be no sermon, shall folowe one of the Homelies alredy set furth, or hereafter to he set furth by commune aucthoritie.



After suche Sermon, homely, or exhortacion, the Curate shall declare unto the people, whether there be anye holy dayes or fastynge dayes the weke folowyng, and earnestly exhorte theim to remembre the poore, saying one, or moe of these sentences following, as he thinketh most convenient by his discretion.





This prayer was changed appropriately for subsequent monarchs, King James & King Charles

Geve almose [alms] of thy goodes, and turne never thy face from any poore man, and then the face of the Lorde shall not be turned away from the.

Tob. iiii

Be mercifull after thy power. If thou hast muche gyve plenteously, if thou hast litle, doe thy diligence gladly to geve of that litle, for so gatherest thou thy selfe a good rewarde in the day of necessitye.

Tob. iiii

He that hath pitye upon the poore, lendeth unto the Lorde: and looke what he layeth out: it shalbe paied him agayne.

Pro xix.

Blessed be the man that provydeth for the sycke, and nedy, the Lorde shall deliver him, in the time of trouble.

Then shal the Churchewardens, or some other by them appoyncted, gather the devocion of the people, and put the same into the poore mens boxe, and upon the offeryng daies appoincted, every man and woman shal pay to the Curate the due and accustomed offerings, after whiche done, the Priest shal saie.

Let us pray for the whole estate of Christes Churche militant here in earth.



Psal. lxi.

ALMIGHTYE and everliving God, whych by thy holye Apostle hast taughte us to make prayers and supplicacyons, and to geve thanckes for all men: We humbly beseche thee moste mercifully (to accepte our almose) and to receyve these our prayers whyche of we offer unto thy divine majestie, beseechyng the to inspire continually, the universal Churche wyth the spiryte of truthe, unitye, and concorde: And graunt that all they that do confesse thy holy name, may agree in the truthe of thy holy woorde, and lyve in unytye and godlye love. We beseche thee also to save and defend alle Christyane Kynges, Prynces, and Governours, and specially thy servaunt, Elyzabeth our Quene that under her we may be godly and quietly governed: and graunt unto her whole Counsaill, and to all that be put in aucthoritye under her, that they may truely and indifferently [impartially] minister justice, to the punishement of wyckednes and vice, and to the maintenaunce of goddes true religion and vertue. Give grace (O heavenly Father) to al Bishopes, Pastours and Curates, that they may bothe by theyr life and doctrine set furth thy true and lively worde and rightely and duely administer thy holy Sacramentes: and to all thy people gyve thy heavenlye grace, and especially to thys congregacion heare present, that with meke harte and due reverence, they may heare and receive thy holy worde, truely servyng the in holines and ryghtuousnes all the dayes of theyr lyfe. And we moost humbly beseche the of thy goodnes (O Lord) to comfort and succoure all theym whyche in thys transitory lyfe bee in trouble, Sorowe, nede, sicknes, or any other adversity. Graunt this, O father, for Jesus Christes sake our onely Mediatour and advocate. Amen.





If ther be none almes geven unto the poore, then shall the words of accepting our almes bee lefte out unsayd.



Then shal folowe this exhortacion, at certayne tymes when the Curate shal see the people negligent to come to the holy Communyon.



WE be come together at thys tyme, derely beloved brethren to fede at the Lordes supper, unto the whyche in Goddes behalf I bydde you all that be heare present, and beseche you for the lorde Jesus Christes sake, that ye wyll not refuse to come thereto, beyng so lovingly called, and bidden of God him selfe. Ye know howe grevous and unkynde a thing it is, when a manne hath prepared a riche feaste: decked his table with al kynde of provisyon, so that there lacketh nothinge but the gestes to sitte downe: and yet they whych be called wythout anye cause, mooste unthankfully refuse to come. Whyche of you in suche a case woulde not be moved? Who woulde not thyncke a greate injurie and wrong done unto hym? Wherefore moste derely beloved in Christe take ye good heade, lest ye, wythdrawyng your selves from this holy supper, and provoke Goddes indignation against you, it is an easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because I am otherwise letted [hindered] with worldly busynes, but suche excuses be not so easily accepted and allowed before god. If any man say, I am a grevous sinner, and therefore am afrayed to come. Wherefore then do ye not repent and amende? When god calleth you, be you not ashamed to say ye wil not come? when you should returne to god, wil you excuse your self and say that you be not redy? Considre ernestly with your selves howe litle such feined excuses shall availe before God. They that refused the feaste in the Gospell, because they had bought a farme, or would trie their yokes of oxen, or because they were maried, were not so excused, but conpted [counted] unworthy of the hevenly feast. I for my part am here present and according to myne office, I bid you in the name of god, I cal you in Christes behalf, I exhort you, as you love your owne Salvation, that ye wil be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the sonne of God, did vouchesafe to yelde up his soule by death upon the crosse for your healthe, even so it is youre duety to receyve the Communion together in the remembraunce of his death as he hymselfe cornmaunded. Nowe, yf ye wyll in no wise thus do, consider with your selves, how great injury ye doe unto God, and howe sore punishment hangeth over your heades for thesame. And whereas ye offende God so sore in refusing this holy banquet, I admonishe, exhorte, and beseche you, that unto this unkyndenes ye wyll not adde any more. Whiche thing ye shall doe yf ye stand by as gasers and lokers of them that do Communicate, and be no partakers of the same your selves. For what thing can this be accompted els, then a further contempt and unkindenes unto God? Truly it is a greate unthankefulnes to saye naye when ye be called, but the faulte ismuche greater, when men stande by, and yet wyll neyther eate, nor drincke this holye Communion with other. I praie you what can this be ells but even to have the misteries of Christ in derision: it is sayde unto al: Take ye and eate, take and drincke ye al of this, do this in remebraunce of me. With what face then, or with what countenaunce shal ye here these wordes? what wyl this be els, but a neglecting, a despisyng, and mockynge of the Testament of Christ? wherfore rather the you shold so do, departe you hence, and geve place to them that be Godly dysposed. But when you departe, I beseche you pondre with yourselves, from whome ye departe: ye departe from the Lordes Table: ye depart from your brethren, and from the banket [banquet] of most heavenly foode. These thynges (yf ye earnestly consydre) ye shall by Goddes grace, returne to a better mynde, for the obteining wherof, we shall make our humble peticions while we shal receive the holy Communion.

And some tyme shalbe said this also, at the discretion of the Curat.

DERELY beloved, for asmuche as our dutye is to rendre to almighty God our heavenly father most harty thanckes for that he hathe geven his sonne our Sauiour Jesus Christ not onely to die for us, but also to be oure Spirituall fode, and sustenaunce, as it is declared unto us, aswel by Goddes worde, as by the holy sacramentes of his blessed body and bloud, the which being so comfortable a thing to them whiche receive it worthelye and so daungerous to them, that wil presume to receyve it, unworthely. My duty is to exhorte you to considre the dignitie of the holy mistery, and the great peril of the unworthy receiving therof, and so to searche and examine youre owne conscieces, as you shold come holy and cleane to a moste godly and hevenly feast, so that in no wise you come but in the mariage garment, required of God in holy scripture, and so come and be receyved as worthye partakers of suche a heavenly Table, the waye and meanes therto is.

First to examine your lives and conversation by the rule of Goddes commaundementes and wherinsoeuer ye shall perceyve your selves to have offended eyther by wil, worde, or deede, there bewayle your owne synfull lives, confesse your selves to almighty God, with ful purpose of amendement of life. And yf ye shal perceive your offences to be such, as be not only against God, but also against your neighbours. Then ye shal reconcyle youre selves unto them, ready to make restitucion and satisfaction according to the uttermost of your powers for all injuries and wronges done by you to any other, and likewise being ready to forgeve other that have offended you as you would have forgevenes of your offences at Goddes hande. For otherwyse the receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing els, but encrease your dampnation.

And because it is requisite that no manne shoulde come to the holye Communion, but with a ful trust in goddes mercy, and with a quiet conscience: therfore yf there be any of you, which by the meanes aforesaid cannot quiet his owne conscience, but requireth further comforte or counsail, then let him come to me, or some other discrete and learned minister of gods word, and open his griefe, that he may receive suche ghostly counseil, advise, and comfort, as his conscience may be releved, and that by the ministery of Gods word, he may receyve comfort, and the benefyte of absolution, to the quieting of his conscience, and advoiding of all scruple and doubtfulnes.

Â¶ Then shall the Priest say this exhortation.

DERELY beloved in the Lorde: Ye that mynde to come to the holye Communion of the bodye and bloude of oure savioure Christe, must consyder what saincte Paule writeth unto the Corinthiens, howe he exhorteth all persones diligentlye to trye and examyne them selves, before they presume to eate of that breade, and drincke of that cuppe. For as the benefyte is greate, yf wyth a trulye penitente herte and lyvely faith we receive that holy sacrament (for then we spiritually eate the fleshe of Christ, and drincke his blonde, then we dwell in Christe and Christe in us, we be one wyth Christ, and Christe with us) so is the daunger great, if we receyve the same unworthely. For then we be gilty of the body and bloud of Christ our saviour. We eate and drincke our owne dampnation, not considering the lordes bodye. we kindle Gods wrath against us, we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundrye kyndes of death. Therfore if any of you be a blasphemer of god, an hinderer or slaunderer of his worde, an adulterer, or be in malyce or envye, or in anye other grevous crime, bewaile your Sinnes, and come not to this holy table, lest after the taking of that holy sacrament, the devil enter into you, as he entred into Judas, and fil you full of al iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of bodye and soule. Judge therefore your selves (brethren) that ye be not judged of the Lord. Repent you truly for your sinnes past, have a lively and stedfast faithe in Christ our saviour. Amende your lives, and be in perfect charitie wyth all men, so shal ye be mete partakers of those holy misteries. And above al thinges ye must geve most humble and herty thankes to God the father, the sone, and the holye ghost, for the redemption of the world by the deathe and passion of our saviour Christ, bothe God and man, who did humble him selfe, even to the deathe, upon the crosse, for us miserable sinners which lay in darckenes, and shadowe of death, that he mighte make us the children of God, and exalte us to everlasting life. And to thende that we should alwaie remembre the exceadinge greate love of our master and onelie saviour Jesu Christ, thus diyng for us, and the innumerable benefites (which by his precious bloudsheading) he hath obteined to us, he hath instituted and ordeined holy misteries, as pledges of his love, and continuall remembraunce of his death, to our great and endles comfort. To him therfore with the father and the holye Ghost, let us geve (as we are moste bounden) continuall thankes, submitting our selves wholy to his holie will and pleasure, and studiyng to serve him in true holines and righteousnes, al the daies of our life. Amen.





Then shall the Priest saye to them that come to receyve the holy Communion.

You that do truly and ernestly repente you of youre sinnes, and be in love, and charite with your neighbors and entende to lede a newe lyfe, folowing the commaundementes of God, and walkynge from hence furthe in his holy waies: Draw nere and take this holy Sacrament to your comforte make your humble confession to almighty God, before this congregation here gathered together in his holye name, mekely knelynge upon your knees.

Â¶	Then shall this generall confession be made, in the name of all those, that are mynded to receyve this holy Communion, either by one of them, or els by one of the ministers, or by the priest him selfe, all kneling humbly upon their knees.

ALMIGHTY God, father of oure Lorde Jesus Christe, maker of all thynges, Judge of all menne, we acknowledge and bewayle oure manifolde synnes and wyckednesse, whiche we from tyme to tyme moste grevously have committed, by thoughte woorde and deede, against thy divine Majestie, provokynge mooste justlye thy wrathe and indignation againste us: we do earnestly repente, and bee hartely sorye for these oure misdoinges, the remembraunce of them is grevous unto us: the burthen of theim is intollerable: have mercy upon us, have mercye upon us, mooste mercyfull father, for thy sonne oure Lorde Jesus Christes sake, forgeve us all that is paste, and graunte that we may ever hereafter serve and please the, in newenes of lyfe, to the honour and glorye of thy name throughe Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

Â¶ Then shall the priest or the Bishop (beyng present) stande up, and turning himself to the people shall say thus.

ALMIGHTYE God, oure heavenly father, who of his great mercy hathe promised forgevenes of sinnes, to al them, whiche with hartye repentaunce and true faithe turne to hym: have mercye upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your sinnes, confirme and strengthen you in all goodnes, and bring you to everlastyng lyfe; through Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

Then shall the Priest also saye.

Here what comfortable wordes our saviour Christ saithe to all them that truly turne to him.

Â¶ COME unto me all that travaile and be heavy laden, and I shal refreshe you. So God loved the world that he gave his onely begotten sonne, to thende that al that beleve in him, should not perishe but have life everlastyng.

Heare also what S. Paule saithe.

Â¶ This is a true saieng, and worthy of all men to be receyved, that Jesus Christ came into the worlde to save synners.

Heare also what S. John saieth.

Â¶ If any manne sinne, we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propiciation for our sinnes.

Â¶ After the whiche the priest shall procede saying.

Lift up your hartes.

Aunswere. We lyfte them up unto the Lorde.

Priest. Let us geve thanckes unto our Lorde God.

Aunswere. It is mete and right so to do.

Â¶ Priest. It is very mete, right, and our bounden duety that we should at al times, and in all places, geve thanckes to the, O Lord holy father, almighty everlasting God.

Here shall folow the proper prefaces, according to the tyme, yf there be any specially appointed, or els immediatly shal folow:

Therfore with aungelles &c.





Â¶ PROPER PREFACES.

Upon Christmas day and seven dayes after.

BECAUSE thou dyddest geve Jesus Christ, thyne onely Sonne, to be borne as this daye for us, who by the operation of the holy ghoste was made very man of the substaunce of the virgin Mary his mother, and that without spot of synne, to make us clene from al sinne. Therefore with aungels &c.

Upon Easter daye, and vii dayes after.

BUT chiefly are we bounde to praise the for the glorious resurrection of thy sonne Jesus Christ our lord, for he is the very paschal lambe, whiche was offred for us, and hath taken awaye the sinne of the world, who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life againe, hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore with aungels

Upon the Ascencion day, and vii dayes after.

THROUGH thy most deare beloved sonne, Jesus Christ our Lorde, who after his moste glorious resurrection, manifestly appered to al his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven, to prepare a place for us, that where he is, thether might we also ascende, and reigne with him in glory. Therfore with aungels &c.

Upon Wytsonday, and vi daies after.

THROUGH Jesu Christ our Lord, according to whose mooste true promyse, the holye ghoste came downe this daye from heaven, with a soddine greate sounde, as it had bene a mighty wynde, in the lykenes of fiery tonges lyghtinge upon the Apostles, to teache them, and to leade them to all truth, geving them bothe the gyfte of divers languages, and also boldnes with fervent zeale, constantly to preache the gospel unto all nacions, whereby we are broughte out of darcknes and errour into the cleare light and true knowledge of the, and of thy sonne Jesus Christ. Therefore with Aungels &c.

Upon the feaste of Trinitie onely.

IT is very mete right, and our bounden dutie, that we should at all times, and in all places, geve thankes to the, O Lorde, almightie and everlasting God, which art one god, one lord, not one only person, but thre persons in one substaunce, for that whiche we beleve of the glorye of the father, the same we beleve of the sonne, and of the holy ghost, without any difference or inequalitie. Therefore &c.

Â¶ After which preface, shall folow immediatly.

THERFORE with Aungelles and Archangelles, and wyth all the company of heaven, we laude and magnify thy glorious name, evermore praising thee, and saying: Holy, holy, holy, lord god of hostes, heven and earth are ful of thy glory, glory be to the, O Lord most hyghe.

Â¶ Then shall the priest knelynge downe at Gods borde, say in the name of all them that shall receyve the communion, this prayer folowing.

WE do not presume to come to this thy table (O merciful Lorde) trustinge in oure owne rightuousnesse, but in thy manifolde and greate mercies, we be not worthy so muche as to gather up the crommes under thy Table, but thou arte the same Lord, whose property is alwaies to have mercy. Graunt us therefore gracious Lorde, so to eate the fieshe of thy deare sonne Jesus Christ, and to drinke his bloude, that oure synful bodies may be made cleane by his body, and our soules washed through his most precious bloud, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us.





Then the priest standing up, shal say as foloweth:

	ALMIGHTY God our heavenly father whiche of thy tender rnercye, diddest give thine onely Sonne Jesus Christ, to suffer death upon the Crosse for our redeption, who made ther (by his one oblation of himself once offered) a ful, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the synnes of the whole worlde, and didde institute, and in his holy gospel commaunde us to continue a perpetual memory of that his precious deathe, untyll his comminge againe: Heare us O merciful father, we besech the, and graunt that we receivyng these thy creatures of breade and wine, accordinge to thy sonne our saviour Jesu Christes holy institution, in remembrauce of his death and passion, may be partakers of his moste blessed body and bloude, who in the same night that he was betraied, toke bread, and when he had geven thankes, he brake it, and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take, eate, this is my bodie, which is geven for you. Doe this in remembraunce of me. Likewise after supper he toke the cuppe, and when he had geven thankes, he gave it to them, saying: Drinke ye all of this, for this is my bloude of the new Testament, whiche is shedde for you and for many, for remission of sinnes: doe this as oft as ye shall drinke it in remembraunce of me.

Â¶	Then shall the minister fyrste receyve the Communion in bothe kyndes him selfe, and next deliver it to other Ministers (yf any be there present, that they may helpe the chief minister) and after to the people in their handes kneling. And when he delivereth the breade, he shall saye.

THE bodie of our lord Jesu Christ, which was geven for the, preserve thy body and soule into everlastinge life: and take and eate this in remembraunce that Christ died for thee, feede on him in thine heart by faith, with thankesgevynge.

And the minister that delivereth the cuppe shall saye.

THE bloude of our lorde Jesu Christ, which was shedd for the, preserve thy body and soule into everlasting life: and drinke this in remembraunce that Christes bloude was shedde for thee, and be thankeful.

Then shall the priest say the Lordes prayer, the people repetynge after him every peticion.

And although we be unworthye throughe our manifolde sinnes, to offer unto the any sacrifice, yet we beseche the to accept this our bounden duty and service, not weighing our merites, but pardoning our offences, throughe Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom and with whom, in the unitie of the holy ghoste, all honour and glorye be unto the, O father almighty, world without ende. Amen.

O Lorde God, heavenlye Kynge, God the father Almightie. O Lorde the onely begotten Sonne Jesu Christ. O Lord God, Lambe of God, Sonne of the father, that takest awaye the sinnes of the worlde, have mercye upon us: Thou that takest awaye the Sinnes of the worlde, have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the synnes of the worlde, receive our praier. Thou that syttest at the right hande of God the Father, have mercy upon us. For thou onely art holy: Thou only art the Lorde, thou only O Christe with the holy Ghost, art most highe in the Glory of God the father. Amen.

Then the Priest or the Byshop, if he be present, shal let them depart with this blessing.

THE peace of God, which passeth all understanding, kepe youre hartes, and mindes in the knowlege and love of God, and of his Sonne Jesu Christe, oure Lorde. And the blessing of God almyghty, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, be among you, and remayne with you alwaies. Amen.

ASSIST us mercifully, O Lorde, in these our Supplications and Praiers, and dispose the way of thy servauntes towarde the attainement of everlasting salvation, that emong al the chaunges, and chaunces of this mortal lyfe, thei may ever be defeded by thy moste gratious, and redy helpe. Through Christ our Lorde. Amen.

O ALMIGHTY Lorde and everlivyng God, vouchesafe we beseche the, to direct, sanctifie, and governe bothe oure heartes, and bodies, in the wayes of thy lawes, and in the worckes of thy commaundementes, that through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we maye bee preserved in bodye and Soule: throughe oure lorde and Savioure Jesus Christe. Amen.

GRAUNT we beseche the almighty God, that the wordes which we have herd this daye with our outward eares, may through thi grace be so graffed [grafted] inwardly in our hartes, that they may bring furth in us the fruite of good living, to the honour and praise of thy name: throughe Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

PREVENTE [Direct] us O Lorde in all our doynges, with thy most gratious favoure, and further us with thy continuall helpe, that in al our workes begonne, continued, and ended in the: we may glorify thy holy name, and finally by thy mercy, obteine everlasting lyfe, Through Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

ALMIGHTY God, the founteine of all wisedom, which knowest oure necessities before we aske, and our ignoraunce in asking, we beseche the to have compassion upon our infirmities, and those thinges which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for oure blindenes we cannot aske, vouchesafe to geve us for the worthines of thy sonne Jesus Christe our Lorde. Amen.

ALMIGHTY God, whiche haste promysed to here the peticions of them that aske in thy sonnes name, we beseche the mercifully to encline thine Eares to us that have made nowe nowe our praiers and supplications unto the, and graunt that those thinges which we have faithfully asked, according to thy wil, may effectually be obteined to the relief of our necessitie, and to the setting furth of thy glory through Jesus Christ our Lorde.

Â¶ CONFIRMACION,


WHEREIN IS CONTEINED A CATECHISME FOR CHILDREN.



1559 Title

The Order of Confirmation, or laying

on of hands upon children baptised, and able

to render an account of their Faith, according

to the Catechisme following.





1604 Title

TO thende that confirmacion may be ministred to the more edifying of suche, as shal receive it (according unto S. Paules doctrine, who teacheth that al things should he doen in ye Church, to the edification of the same) it is thought good that none hereafter shalbe confyrmed but suche as can saie in their mother tongue the articles of the faith, the Lordes praier, and the x Commaundementes: And can also answere to suche questions of this short Catechisme, as the Bishop (or suche as he shal appoinct) shal by hys discretion appose [=examine] theim in. And this order is most convenient to be observed for divers consideracions.

First, because that when children come to the yeres of discrecion, and have learned what their godfathers and godmothers promised for them in Baptisme, they may then themselves wyth their owne mouthe, and wyth their awne consent, openly before the Churche, ratifie and confyrme the same, and also promise that by the grace of God, they shall evermore endevour themselfes faithfully to observe and kepe suche thynges, as they by theyr owne mouth and confession have assented unto.

Secondly, forasmuche as Confirmacion is ministred to theym that be Baptised, that by imposition of handes and prayer, they may receive strengthe and defence agaynst all temptacions to synne, and the assaultes of the worlde and the Devill: it is most mete to be ministred when children come to that age, that partely by the frailtye of their awne fleshe, partely by the assaultes of the worlde and the Devil, thei begyn to be in daunger to fal into sondry kyndes of synne.

Thirdly, for that it is agreable wyth the usage of the Churche, in times paste, wherby it was ordeined that Confirmacion shoulde he ministred to them that were of perfecte [=proper, appropriate] age, that they, beyng instructed in Christes religion, should openly professe their awne faithe, and promise to be obedient unto the wyl of God.

And that no man shal thyncke that any detryment shall come to children by diferring [deferring] of their Confirmacion; he shal knowe for truth, that it is certeine by Goddes worde, that children beyng baptised, have all thynges necessarie for their salvacion, and be undoubtedly saved.





A CATECHISME,

THAT IS TO SAY,

Question. WHAT is your name?

Aunswere. N. or M.

Question. Who gave you this name?

Aunswere. My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptisme, wherein I was made a membre of Christe, the childe of God, and an inheritour of the kingdome of heaven.

Question. What did your godfathers and godmothers then for you?

Aunswere. They did promise, and vowe iii thinges in my name. First, that I should forsake the devil, and all his [workes and pompes, the]* vanities of the wicked worlde, and al the sinful lustes of the fleshe. Secondly, that I should beleve al the articles of the Christian faith. And thirdely, that I should kepe Goddes holy wil and Commaundemetes, and walke in the same al the daies of my lyfe.

* "workes, the pompes and" in 1604.





Question. Doest thou not thynke that thou art bounde to beleve and to do, as they have promised for the?

Answer. Yes verely, and by Goddes helpe so I wil. And I hartely thanke our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this state of salvation, through Jesus Christe our saviour. And I pray God to geve me his grace, that I may continue in the same unto my lyves ende.

Question. Reherse the Articles of thy belefe.

Aunswere. I beleve in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and of earth. And in Jesus Christe his onely Sonne our Lorde. Whiche was conceived of the holy Ghost. Borne of the Virgine Mary. Suffered under Ponce Pylate, was crucifyed, deade and buried, he descended into hell. The thyrd day he rose agayne from the dead. He ascended into heven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From thence he shal come to judge the quicke and the dead. I beleve in the Holy ghost. The holy catholike Churche. The Communion of saynctes. The forgivenes of synnes. The resurrection of the body. And the lyfe everlastinge. Amen.

Question. What doest thou chiefly learne in these artycles of thy beliefe?

Aunswere. Firste, I learne to beleve in God the father, who hath made me and al the worlde.

Secondlye, in God the sonne, who hath redemed me and all mankinde.

Thirdly, in God the holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the elect people of God.

Question. You said, that your godfathers and godmothers, dyd promise for you, that you shoulde kepe Gods commaundementes. Tell me how many there be?

Aunswere. Tenne.

Question. Whiche be they?

Aunswere. The same which God spake in the .xx. cha of Exodus, saying: I am the Lord thy God whyche have brought the out of the land of Egypt, oute of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have none other goddes but me.

II. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image nor the lykenes of any thyng that is in heaven above, or in the earthe beneth, nor in the water under the earthe: thou shalt not bow doune to them nor worship them. For I the Lorde thy God, am a gelous God, and visyte the sinnes of the fathers upon the chyldren, unto the iii and fourth generacion of them that hate me, and shewe mercye unto thousandes of them that love me, and kepe my commaundementes.

III. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, for the Lorde will not holde hym guiltles that taketh his name in vaine.

IIII. Remember thou kepe holy the Sabboth day. Syxe daies shalt thou laboure, and do all that thou hast to do: but the vii day is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt do no maner of worcke, thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man servaunt, and thy maydservaunt, thy cattel, and the straunger that is wythin thy gates: for in sixe daies the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and al that in them is, and rested the vii day, wherfore the Lorde blessed the vii day, and halowed it.

V. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy daies may be long in the lande, whiche the Lorde thy God geveth the.

VI. Thou shalt do no murther.

VII. Thou shalt not committe adultery.

VIII. Thou shalt not steale.

X. Thou shalt not covet thy neyghbours house, thou shalt not covet thy neyghboures wyfe, nor hys servaunt, nor hys mayde, nor hys oxe nor hys asse, nor any thyng that is hys.

Question. What doest thou chiefly learne by these commandementes?

Aunswere. I learne two thynges. My duty towardes God, and my dutye towardes my neighbour.

Question. What is my duety towardes God?

Aunswere. My dutye towardes God is, to beleve in him, to feare him [=to hold him in awe], and to love hym with all my harte, with al my mynde, with al my soule, and with all my strengthe. To worship hym. To geve hym thanckes. To putte my whole truste in hyrn. To call upon hym. To honour hys holy name and hys woorde, and to serve hym truely all the dayes of my lyfe.

Question. What is thy dutye toward thy neighbour?

Aunswere. My dutye towardes my neyghbour is to love hym as my selfe: And to do to all men as I would they should do unto me. To love, honour, and succour my father and mother. To honour and obey the Kyng, and his minysters. To submitte my selfe to al my governours, teachers, spiritual Pastours and Maisters. To order my selfe lowly and reverently to all my betters. To hurte no body by worde, nor dede. To be true and juste in all my dealyng. To beare no malice nor hatred in my harte. To kepe my handes from pickyng and stealyng, and my tongue from evil speakyng, liyng and slaunderyng. To kepe my body in temperaunce, sobernes, and chastitie. Not to covet nor desire other mennes goodes. But learne and labour truely to get myne awne livyng, and to do my dutye in that state of life, unto whiche it shal please God to cal me.

Question. My good child know this, that thou art not able to do these thinges of thy self, nor to walke in the commaundementes of God, and to serve hym, wythout hys specyall grace, whyche thou must learne at al tymes to cal for by diligent prayer. Let me heare therfore, if thou canst saye the Lordes praier.

Aunswere. Our Father whiche art in heaven; Hallowed be thy name. Thy kyngdom come. Thy wil be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Geve us this day our daily bread. And forgeve us our trespasses, as we forgeve them that trespasse against us. And leade us not into temptacion. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Question. What desirest thou of God in this praier?

Aunswere. I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the gever of al goodness, to send his grace unto me, and to all people, that we may worship hym, serve hym, and obeye hym as we ought to doe. And I pray unto God, that he will sende us all thynges that be nedefull, bothe for our soules and bodies. And that he will be merciful unto us, and forgeve us our sinnes: and that it wil please him to save and defende us in al daungers ghostly [=spiritually] and bodily : and that he will kepe us from all synne and wikednes, and from our ghostly enemy, and from everlastyng death. And this I trust he wil do of his mercye and goodnes, throughe our lord Jesu Christ. And therefore I say. Amen. So be it.

O	GOD, from whome all holy desires, all good counsailes, and all just woorkes do procede: geve unto thy servauntes that peace, whiche the worlde cannot geve: that bothe our hertes may be set to obey thy commaundementes, and also that by thee, we beynge defended from the feare of our enemies, may passe our time in rest and quietnes.

LYGHTEN oure darckenesse, wee beseche thee (O Lorde,) and by thy greate mercye defende us from all perils and daungers of this nyghte, for the lone of thy onely sonne oure Savioure Jesus Christe. Amen.





In	the feastes of christmas, the Epiphany, S. Mathye, Easter, the Assencion, Pentecost, S. John Baptyst, S. James, S. Bartholomew, S. Mathew, S. Simon, and Jude, S. Andrew, and Trinitie Sonday: Shalbe songe or sayde immediatly after Benedictus, thys confession of our Christen faythe.

WHOSOEVER wyll be saved : before all thynges it is necessarye that he holde the catholyke faythe.

Whiche Faithe, excepte everye one dooe kepe holy, and undefyled : withoute doubt he shall perysh everlastingly.

And the Catholyke Faythe is this : that we worshyp one God in Trinitie, and trinitie in unitie.

Neyther confounding the persons : nor devidinge the substaunce.

For there is one persone of the Father, an other of the Sonne : and another of the holy ghost.

But the Godhed of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost, is al one : the glory equall, the majesty coeternall.

Suche as the Father is, such is the sonne : and suche is the holy ghost.

The father uncreate, the sonne uncreate : and the holy ghoste uncreate.

The Father incomprehensible, the sonne incomprehensible : and the holy Ghoste incomprehensible.

The father eternall, the sonne eternall : and the holye Ghoste eternall.

And yet they are not thre eternalles : but one eternall.

As also there be not thre incomprehensibles, nor thre uncreated : but One uncreated, and one incomprehensible.

So likewyse the Father is almighty, the sonne almighty : and the holy ghoste almighty.

And yet are not there thre Almighties, but one almighty.

So the father is God, the sonne is God : and the holye Ghoste is God.

And yet are they not thre Gods : but one God.

So lykewyse the father is Lord, the sonne Lorde : and the holy ghoste Lorde.

And yet not thre Lordes : but one Lord.

For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity : to acknowledge every person by hym selfe to be God, and Lorde.

So are we forbidden by the Catholique Religion : to say there be thre Gods, or thre Lordes.

The father is made of none : neyther created, nor begotten.

The sonne is of the Father alone : not made, nor created, but begotten.

The holye Ghoste is of the Father, and of the Sonne : neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceding.

So there is one father, not thre fathers, one sonne, not thre sonnes : one holy Ghost, not thre holy Ghostes.

And in this trinitie, none is afore, or after other : none is greater, nor lesse than other.

But the whole thre persons : be coeternall toguether and coequall.

So that in all thinges as is aforesayde : the Unitye in Trinitie, and the Trinitie in unitie is to be worshypped.

He therefore that wil be saved : must thus thincke of the Trinitie.

Furthermore, it is necessarye to everlasting salvation : that he also beleve rightlye in the Incarnation of oure Lorde Jesu Christ.

For the right Faythe is, that we beleve and Confesse : that oure Lorde Jesus Christe the sonne of God, is God and Man;

God of the Substaunce of the father, begotten before the worldes : and man of the substauce of his mother, borne in the worlde.

Perfect god, and perfect man of a reasonable Soule, and humaine flesh subsistynge.

Equal to the father as touchyng his godhead : and inferior to the father, touchyng his manhode.

Who although he be God and man : yet he is not two, but one Christ.

One; not by conversion of the Godhead into fleshe: but by taking of the manhode into God;

One altogether, not by confusion of Substaunce: but by unitie of person.

For as the reasonable soule and flesh is but one man : so God and man is but one Christ.

Who suffred for our salvation : descended into hell, rose againe the thirde day from the deade.

He ascended into heaven: he sitteth bn the ryghte hand of the father, God Almighty, from whence he shall come to judge the quicke and the dead.

At whose comming all men shal rise againe with their bodies and shall geve accompt for their owne worckes.

And they that have done good, shall go into life everlasting and they that have done evel, into everlastyng fyre.

This is the Catholike faith, whiche except a man beleve faithfully, he can not be saved.

Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy Ghoste.

As it was in the beginninge, is nowe, and ever shalbe : worlde without ende. Amen.

Thus endeth the order of Morning and Eveninge Prayer through the whole yere.

GODLY PRAYERS.

Â¶ CERTAINE GODLY PRAYERS TO BE USED FOR SUNDRY PURPOSES.



A generall confession of sinnes, to be said every morning.

O ALMIGHTIE God, our heavenly Father, I confesse and knowledge, that I am a miserable and a wretched sinner, and have manifold waies most grievouslie transgressed thy most godly commaundements, through wicked thoughts, ungodly lusts, sinfull words and deeds, and in my whole life. In sinne am I borne and conceived, and there is no goodnesse in mee; inasmuch as if thou shouldest enter into thy narrowe judgement with me, judging me according unto the same, I were never able to suffer or abide it, but must needes perish and be dampned [damned] for ever: So little help, comfort, or succoure is there either in me, or in any other creature. Onely this is my comfort (O heavenly Father), that thou diddest not spare thy onely deare beloved sonne, but diddest give him up unto the most bitter, and most vile and slaunderous death of the Crosse for me, that hee might so pay the ransome for my sinnes, satisfie thy judgement, still and pacifie thy wrath, reconcile me againe unto thee, and purchase me thy grace and thy favour, and everlasting life. Wherfore, through the merite of his most bitter death and passion, and through his innocent bloodshedding, I beseech the, O heavenly Father, that thou wilt vouchsafe to bee gracious and mercifull unto me, to forgive and pardon me al my sinnes, to lighten my harte with thy holy Spirit, to renue, confirme, and strengthen me with a right and a perfecte faith, and to inflame mee in love toward thee and my neighbour, that I may hencefurth with a willing and a glad harte, walke as becommeth me, in thy most godly commaundements, and so glorifie and praise the everlastingly. And also that I may with a free conscience and quiet hert, in all manner of temptations, afflictions, or necessities, and even in the verie pangs of death, crie boldly and merily unto thee, and say : I beleve in God the Father Almightie, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, &c. But, O Lord God heavenly father, to comfort myselfe in affliction and temptation with these articles of the Christian faithe, it is not in my power, for faith is thy gift: and forasmuch as thou wilt bee prayed unto, and called upon for it, I come unto thee, to pray and beseech the, both for that and for all my other necessities, even as thy desre beloved Sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christ himselfe hath taught us. And from the very bottome of my heart I cry, and say: Our Father, which art in heaven. &c.





These prayers were never officially part of the Book of Common Prayer, but were often bound up with it. The prayers given here come from three sources. The first is from a 1567 BCP, as found in an 1847 reprint, Liturgical Services in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. The second and third are from actual Books of Common Prayer published in 1599 and 1634. The presence of each prayer in each BCP is indicated at the right.

These prayers are also found bound up with the 1552 BCP, in substantially the same form as in the 1567 Book





1567, 1599, 1634





Â¶ Prayers to be said in the Morning.

O MERCIFULL Lord God, heavenly Father, I render most high laudes, praise, and thankes unto thee, that thou hast preserved me both this night, and all the time and daies of my life hitherto, under thy protection, and hast suffered mee to live untill this present houre. And I beseech thee hartily, that thou wilt vouchsaufe to receive me this day, and the residue of my whole life, from hencefurth into thy tuition [=protection], ruling and governing me with thy holie Spirit, that all maner of darknes, of misbeleefe, infidelitie, and of carnall lusts and affections, may be utterly chased and driven out of my harte, and that I may be justified and saved both bodie and soule through a right and a perfect faith, and so walke in the light of thy most godly trueth, to thy glorie and praise, and to the profite and furtherance of my neighbour, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Amen.



1567, 1599, 1634

ALL possible thankes that wee are able, wee render unto thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, for that thou hast willed this night past to bee prosperous unto us; and we beseech thee likewise to prosper all this same day unto us for thy glorie, and for the helth of our soule: and that thou which art the true light, not knowing any going downe, and which art the Sunne eternall, giving life, foode, and gladnes unto all things, vouchsaufe to shine into our minds, that we may not any where stumble to fall into any sin, but may thorow [through] thy good guiding and conducting, come to the life everlasting. Amen.

1567, 1599

O LORD Jesus Christ, which art the true Sun of the world, evermore arising, and never going downe, which by thy most holesome appearing and sight, doest bring foorth, preserve, nourish, and refresh all things, as well that are in heaven, as also that are on earth : we beseech thee mercifully and favourably to shine into our hearts, that the night and darknesse of sins, and the mists of errors on every side driven away, thou brightly shining within our harts, we may all our life space go without any stumbling or offence, and may decently and seemely walk, (as in the day time,) being pure and cleane from the works of darknes, and abounding in all good works which God hath prepared for us to walk in: which with the Father and with the holie Ghost livest and reignest for ever and ever. Amen.

1567, 1599, 1634;

also found in the 1545 Primer

O GOD and Lord Iesus Christ, thou knowest, yea, and hast also taught us, how great the infirmitie and weakenesse of man is, and how certaine a thing it is that it can nothing doe without thy godly helpe. If man trust to himselfe, it cannot bee avoyded, but that hee must headlong runne and fall into a thousand undoings and mischiefs. O our Father, have thou pitie and compassion upon the weakenesse of us thy children, bee thou prest [=willing] and readie to helpe us, alwaies shewing thy mercie upon us, and prospering whatsoever we godly go about: so that, thou giving us light, wee may see what things are truely good in deede; thou encouraging us, wee may have an earnest desire to the same; and thou being our guide, wee may come where to obtaine them : for wee having nothing but mistrust in our selves, doe yeeld and commit our selves full and whole unto thee alone, which workest all things in al creatures, to thy honour and glorie. So be it.

A prayer against temptation.

O LORD Jesus Christ, the only stay and fence of our mortall state, our onely hope, our onely salvation, our glorie, and our triumph, who in the flesh (which thou hadst for our only cause taken upon thee) diddest suffer thy selfe to be tempted of Sathan, and who onely and alone of all men diddest utterly overcome and vanquish sinne, death, the world, the divell, and all the kingdome of hell : and whatsoever thou hast so overcommed, for our behoofe [behalf] it is that thou hast overcommed it : neither hath it been thy will to have any of thy servants to keepe battel or fight with any of the foresaid evils, but of purpose to rewarde us with a crowne of the more glorie for it. And to the intent that thou mightest likewise overthrow Sathan in thy members, as thou haddest afore done in thine owne person, give thou (wee beseech thee) unto us thy souldiers (O Lion most victorious of the tribe of Juda) strength against the roring Lion, which continually wandreth to and fro, seeking whom he may devoure. Thou being that same Serpent, the true giver of health and life, that were nailed on high upon a tree, give unto us, thy little seelie ones, wilinesse against the deceitfull awayting of the most subtile serpent. Thou being a Lambe as white as snow, the vanquisher of Satans tyranie, give unto us thy little sheep the strength and vertue of thy spirit, that being in our owne selves weake and feeble, and in thee strong and valiant, wee may withstand and overcome all assaults of the divell, so that our ghostly enemie may not glorie on us, but being conquered through thee, we may give thankes to thy mercie, which never leaveth them destitute that put their trust in thee : who livest and reignest God for ever without end. Amen.



1567, 1599

A prayer for the obtaining of wisedome.

O GOD of our fathers, and Lord of mercie, thou that hast made all things with thy word, and ordeined man through thy wisdome, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, that he should order the world according to equitie and righteousnesse, and execute judgement with a true heart : give me wisedome, which is ever about thy state, and put me not out from among thy children : for I thy servant and sonne of thy handmaid am a feeble person, of a short time, and too young to the understanding of thy judgementes and lawes : yea, though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisedome be not with him, he shall be nothing worth. O send thy wisedome out of thy holie heavens, and from the throne of thy majestie, that she may be with me and labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable in thy sight; for she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall conduct me right soberly in thy workes, and preserve me in her power: so shall my workes be acceptable. Amen.

A prayer against worldly carefulnesse.

O MOST deare and tender father, our defender and nourisher, endue us with thy grace, that we may cast off the great blindnesse of our mindes, and carefulnesse of worldlie things, and maye put our whole studie and care in keeping of thy holie law ; and that wee may labour and travaile for our necessities in this life, like the birds of the ayre, and the lillies of the field, without care. For thou hast promised to be carefull for us, and hast commaunded that upon thee we should cast al our care : which livest and reignest, world without end. Amen.

A prayer necessary for all persons.

O MERCIFULL God, I wretched sinner reknowledge [acknowledge] myselfe bound to keepe thy holie commaundements, but yet unable to performe them, and to bee accepted for just without the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ thy onely Sonne, who hath perfectly fulfilled thy law, to justifie all men that beleeve and trust in him. Therefore graunt me grace, I beseech thee, to be occupied in doing of good workes, which thou commaundest in holie scripture, all the daies of my life, to thy glorie, and yet to trust onely in thy mercie, and in Christes merites, to bee pourged from my sinnes, and not in my good workes, be they never so many. Give me grace to love thy holie word fervently, to search the Scriptures diligently, to reade them humblie, to understand them truly, to live after them effectually. Order my life so, O Lord, that it be alwaye acceptable unto thee. Give me grace not to rejoyce in any thing that displeaseth thee, but evermore to delight in those things that please thee, be they never so contrary to my desires. Teach me so to pray, that my petitions may be graciously heard of the. Keepe me upright among diversities of opinions and judgements in the worldy that I never swarve [swerve] from thy trueth taught in holie Scripture. In prosperitie, O Lord, save me, that I waxe not proude. In adversitie helpe me, that I never despaire nor blaspheme thy holie name, but taking it patiently, to give thee thankes, and trust to be delivered after thy pleasure. When I happen to falle into sinne through frailtie, I beseech thee to worke true repentance in my heart, that I may bee sorie without desperation, trust in thy mercie without presumption, that I may amend my life, and become truely religious without hypocrisie, lowly in heart without faining, faithfull and trustie without deceit, merie without lightnesse, sad without mistrust, sober without slouthfulnesse, content with mine owne without covetousnesse, to tell my neighbour his faults charitably without dissimulation, to instruct my household in thy lawes truely, to obey our Kyng and all governours under him* unfainedly, to receive all lawes and common ordinances (which disagreeth not from thy holie word) obediently, to pay every man that which I owe unto him truely, to backbite no man, nor slander my neighbour secretly, and to abhorre all vice, loving all goodnesse earnestly. O Lord, graunt me thus to doe, for the glorie of thy holy name. Amen.

A prayer necessary to be said at all times.

O BOUNTIFUL Jesu, O swete saviour, O Christ the sonne of God, have pitie upon me, mercifully heare me, and despyse not my prayers. Thou hast created me of nothing, thou hast redemed me from the bondage of sinne, death, and hel, nether [neither] with golde nor silver, but with thy moste precious body once offred upon the crosse, and thine own bloud shed once for al for my raunsome : therefore cast me not away, whom thou by thy great wisdom haste made : despise me not, whom ye hast redemed with such a precious treasure. Nor let my wickednes destroy that, which thy goodnes hath builded. Nowe whiles I live, O Jesu have mercy on me, for if I dye oute of thy favour, it wil be to late afterward to cal for thy mercy : whiles I have time to repent, loke upon me with thy merciful eyes, as thou diddest vouchsafe to loke upon Peter thine Apostle, that I may bewaile my sinfull lyfe, and obteyne thy favour, and die therin. I reknowledge [acknowledge], that if thou shouldest deale with me according to very justice, I have deserved everlasting death. Therefore I appele to thy high throne of merci trusting to obtaine Gods favoure, not for my merites, but for thy merites, O Jesu, who hast geven thy self an acceptable sacrifice to thy father, to appease his wrath, and to bring all sinners, (truly repenting and amending their evyl lyfe) into his favour again. Accept me, O lord, among the numbre of them that shal be saved, forgeve my sines, geve me grace to leade a godly and innocent life, graunt me thy heavenly wisdom, inspyre my heart with fayth, hope, and charitie ; geve me grace to bee humble in prosperitie, patient in adversitie, obedient to my rulers, faithful unto them that trust me, dealing truely with al men, to live chastely in wedlocke, to abhorre adultery, fornication, and al unclennes, to doe good after my power unto al men, to hurt no man, that thi name may be glorified in me, during this present life, and that I afterward may obteine everlasting life, thorow [through] thy merci, and ye merites of thi passion. Amen.

A prayer for trust in God.

THE beginning of the fall of man was trust in himselfe. The beginning of the restoring of man, was distrust in himselfe, and trust in God.

A prayer for the concorde of Christes church.

ARYSE Lorde, let thine enemies be scattered, thy haters put to flight, the righteous and Christes disciples make pleasaunt and mery, let them sing prayses and pleasaunt songes unto thee, let them blowe abrode thy magnificence, let them moste highly avaunce [advance] thy majestie, let thy glorye grow, let the kingdom of Christ from heaven among the chosen be enlarged : bee thou the father of the fatherles, the judge of the widowes, and the protectour of them, namely [=especially] whom the world forsaketh, whose consciences be troubled, whom the world pursueth for Christes sake, whiche be nedy and wrapped full of misery. In thy house O lord, let us dwel in peace and concord, geve us al one heart, one minde, one true interpretacion upon thy word. Pluck of the bandes, aswell from the consciences as from the bodies of the miserable captives, and of them also whiche as yet bee hedged in within the lystes [=boundaries] of death, and unadvisedly strive against grace. How drye (lord) is the flocke of thyne heritage! I praye thee, powre [pour] downe largely the showres of thy graces, lette a more plenteous fruitefulnes chaunce, let thy people be strengthened with thy spirite : Graunt us lord thy word aboundantly, so that there may be many preachers of thy Gospel, which maye within them selves holily conspire and agree. Lette the church, the spouse of Christ, deale large spoyles of the conquered Sathan. All that beleeve in thee, by Christe (O lorde God of health), mought [might] lyft thee up with prayses, might renoume [=bring fame to] thee and extolle thee. We bee entered into the voyage of salvation. Conducte us luckelye unto the porte, that beeynge delyvered by thee from the verye death, we maye escape and come to the verye lyfe. Finishe the thinge that thou hast begon in us, make us to increase from faith to faith, leave us not to our own wil and choise, for it is slippery and redy to fal. To the thunderboltes of thy word put violence, that we may geve the glory to thee alonely. Geve to thy people courage and power to withstande synne, and to obeye thy worde in all thinges : O Lorde God most glorious and excellent over all.

A prayer agaynst the enemies of Christes trueth.

DELYVER me O Lorde, from the ungodly and stiffenecked persons, for thou seest how in theyr hartes they ymagine mischiefe, and have great pleasure to picke quarelles, theyr tongues bee more sharpe than any adders sting, and under theyr lippes lurketh poison of adders. But, O merciful Lord, let me not fal into theyr handes, that they handle not me after theyr owne lustes. Thou onely art my God, thou must heare my pieteous plaint : Lord, that rulest al together, that art the strength and power of my defence, bee thou as a sallet [=helmet] on my head whensoever the ungodlye shal assault me : neyther suffre thou not the wicked thus to prosper in their matters. Suffre not their croked and malicious stomackes to encrease, and spitefully revyle thee. Loke upon thy porre wretches cause, and ridde me oute of these dayly grevaunces, then shall I with a right up heart and pleasaunt countenaunce extoll and magnifye thy holye name. Amen.

HOW hast thou (O Lord) humbled and plucked me downe. I dare now uneths [=scarcely] make my prayers unto thee, for thou art angrie with me, but not without my deserving. Certainly I have sinned, Lord, I confesse it; I will not deny it; but, oh my God, pardon my trespasses, release my debts, render now thy grace againe unto me, stop my wounds, for I am all to plagued and beaten: yet Lord this notwithstanding I abide patiently, and give mine attendance on thee, continually waiting for reliefe at thy hand, and that not without skill; for I have received a token of thy favour and grace towards me, I meane thy word of promise concerning Christ, who for me was offered on the Crosse for a ransome, a sacrifice and price for my sins : wherefore, acccording to that thy promise, defend me Lord by thy right hand, and give a gracious eare to my requests, for al mans staies are but vaine. Beate downe therefore mine enemies thine owne selfe with thy power, which art mine onely ayder and protector, O Lord God almightie. Amen.

O MERCIFULL Lorde God, heavenly Father, whether we sleepe or wake, live or die, we are alwaies thine. Wherefore I beseech thee hartily that thou wilt vouchsafe to take care and charge of me, and not to suffer me to perish in the workes of darknesse, but to kindle the light of thy countenaunce in my heart, that thy godly knowledge may daily increase in mee, through a right and pure faith, and that I may alwayes bee found to wake and live after thy will and pleasure, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.

Â¶ A prayer to be said at the houre of death.

O LORD Jesus, which art the onely health of all men living, and the everlasting life of them which die in faith : I wretched sinner give and commit my self wholy unto thy most blessed will. And I being sure that the thinge cannot perish which is committed unto thy mercie, willingly now I leave this fraile and wicked flesh, in hope of the resurrection, which in better wise shal restore it to me againe. I beseech thee, most mercifull Lord Jesus Christ, that thou wilt by thy grace make strong my soule against all temptations, and that thou wilt cover and defend me with the buckler of thy mercie against al the assaults of the divell [devil]. I see and knowledge [acknowledge], that there is in myselfe no helpe of salvation, but all my confidence, hope, and trust, is in thy most mercifull goodnesse. I have no merites, nor good workes, which I may alleage before thee. Of sinnes and evill workes (alas) I see a great heape, but through thy mercie, I trust to bee in the number of them, to whom thou wilt not impute their sinnes, but take and accept me for righteous and just, and to bee the inheritour of everlasting life. Thou, mercifull Lord, was borne for my sake, thou diddest suffer both hunger and thirst for my sake, thou diddest preach and teach, thou diddest pray and fast for my sake, thou diddest all good workes and dedes for my sake, thou sufferedst most grievous paines and tormentes for my sake : And finally thou gavest thy most precious bodie to die, and thy blood to bee shed on the crosse for my sake. Now most mercifull Saviour, let all these things profit me, which thou freely hast given me, that hast given thy selfe for me. Let thy blood cleanse and wash away the spots and foulenes of my sinnes. Let thy righteousnesse hide and cover my unrighteousnesse. Let the merites of thy passion and blood, bee the satisfaction for my sinnes. Give me Lord thy grace, that my faith and salvation in thy blood waver not in me, but be ever firme and constant, that the hope of thy mercie and life everlasting never decay in me, that charitie waxe not cold in me. Finally, that the weakenesse of my flesh bee not overcome with the feare of death. Graunt me, mercifull Saviour, that when death hath shut up the eyes of my bodie, yet that the eyes of my soule may still beholde and looke upon thee : that when death hath taken away the use of my tongue and speech, yet that my heart may crie and say unto thee, In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum (that is to say) O Lord, into thy hands I give and commit my soule : Domine Iesu, accipe spiritum meum : Lord Iesu, receive my soule unto thee, Amen. Amen.

Â¶ Another prayer for the Morning

O Almightie and most gracious God, we heartily thanke thee for the sweet sleepe and comfortable rest which thou hast given us this night : and forasmuch as thou hast commanded by thy holy Word, that no man should be idle, but all occupied in godly and vertuous exercises, every man according to his calling : we most humbly beseech thee, that thine eyes may attend upon us, dayly defend us, cherish, comfort, and governe us and all our counsailes [=deliberations], studies, and labours, in such wise, that wee may spend and bestow this day according to thy most holy will, without the hurting of our neighbours, and that wee may diligently and warily eschew and avoid all things that should displease thee, set thee alwayes before our eyes, live in thy feare, working that which may bee found acceptable before thy divine Majestie, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Â¶ A prayer for the Evening

O Most mighty Lord our Father, and God everlasting, full of pity and compassion, we acknowledge and confesse, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to present our selves before thy Majestie, with confidence that thou wilt heare our prayers, and grant our requests, if we consider our own deserving : For our consciences doe accuse us, and our sins witnesse against us, and we know that thou art an upright Judge, which doest not justifie the sinners and wicked men, but punishest the faults of such as transgresse thy Commandements. Yet most mercifull Father, sith [=since] it hath pleased thee to command us to call upon thee in all out troubles and adversities, promising even then to helpe us, when we feele our selves (as it were) swallowed up by death and desperation : wee utterly renounce all wordly confidence, & flee to thy Soveragine bounty, as our onely stay and refuge, beseeching thee not to call to remembrance our manifold sins and wickednesse, whereby we continually provoke thy wrath and indignation against us, neither our negligence & unkindnesse, which have neither worthily esteemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet comfort of thy Gospel revealed unto us, but rather accept the obedience and death of thy Son Jesus Christ, who by offering by his body in sacrifice once for all, hath made sufficient recompence for all our sinnes. Have mercie therefore upon us, O Lord, and forgive us our offences. Teach us by thy holy Spirit, that we may rightly weigh them, and earnestly repent for the same : and so much the rather, O Lord, because that the reprobate, and such as thou hast forsaken, cannot praise thee, nor call upon thy Name : but the repenting heart, the sorrowfull minde, the conscience oppressed, hungring and thirsting for thy grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and glorie. And albeit wee be but worms and dust, yet thou art our Creatour, and wee be the worke of thine hands : yea, thou art our Father, and we thy chidren : thou art our Shepherd, and wee thy flocke : thou art our Redeemer, and we thy people whom thou hast bought : thou art our God, and wee thine inheritance. Correct us not therefoe in thy anger, O Lord, neither according to our deserts punish us, but mercifully chastise us with a fatherly affection, that all the world may know that at what time soever a sinner doeth repent him of his sinne from the bottome of his heart, thou wilt put away his wickednesse out of thy remembrance, as thou hast promised by thine holy Prophet.

Finally, forasmuch as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest in, as thou hast ordained him the day to travaile [toil] in : Grant, O deare Father, that we may so take our bodily rest, that our soules may continually watch for ye time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appeare for our deliverance out of this mortall life, and in the meane season, that we, not overcome by any fantasies, dreames, or other temptations, may fully set our mindes upon thee, love thee, feare [=revere] thee, and rest in thee : Furthermore, that our sleepe be not excessive, or overmuch, after the unsatiable desires of our flesh : but onely sufficient to content out weake nature, that wee may bee the better disposed to live in godly conversation [=behaviour], to the glory of thy holy Name, and profit of our brethren. Amen.

Â¶ The prayer of Manasseth King of the Jewes.

O Lord Almighty, God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed, which hast made heaven and earth with all their ornament, which hast bound the Sea by the word of thy Commandement, which hast shut up the deepe and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious Name, whom all doe feare, and tremble before thy power : for the Majestie of thy glorie cannot bee borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable [=unendurable], but thy mercifull promise is unmeasureable and unsearchable. For thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, long suffering, and most mercifull and repentest for mans miseries. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hath promised* repentance and forgivenesse to them that sin against thee, and for thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may bee saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not* sinned against thee, but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner. For I have sinned above the number of the sand of the Sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplyed : my transgressions are exceeding many : and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of the heavens for the multitude of mine unrighteousnesse. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have I any release : For I have provoked thy wrath, and done evill before thee. I did not thy will, neither kept I thy Commandements. I have set up abominations, and have multiplyed offences. Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my transgressions : but I humbly beseech thee, forgive me : O Lord forgive me, & destroy me not with my transgressions. Be not angry with mee for ever, by reserving evill for mee, neither condemne me unto the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent : and in mee thou wilt shew all thy goodnesse : for thou wilt save me that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy : therefore I will praise thee for ever all the dayes of my life. For all the powers of the heavens praise thee, and thine is the glorie for ever and ever. Amen.

* Thou hast promised that repentence shall be the way for them to return to thee.

* He speaketh this in compassion of himself and those holy Fathers which have their commemorations in the Scriptures, so that in respect of himself, he calleth their sinnes nothing but attributeth unto them righteousnesse.



Â¶ A Prayer containing the duty of every true Christian

O Most mightie GOD, mercifull and loving Father, I wretched sinner come unto thee in the Name of thy dearely beloved Sonne Jesus Christ my onely Saviour and Redeemer : and I most humbly beseech thee for his sake to bee mercifull unto mee, and to cast all my sinnes out of thy sight and remembrance through the merits of his bloody death and Passion. Powre [Pour] upon me (O Lord) the holy Spirit of wisedome and grace : governe and leade me by thy holy word, that it may be a lanterne unto my feet, and a light unto my steps. Shew thy mercy upon me, and so lighten my naturall blindnes and darknesse of my heart through thy grace, that I may daily be renewed by the same Spirit and grace : By the which (O Lord) purge the grossenesse [=coarseness] of my hearing and understanding, that I may profitably read, heare, and understand the word and heavenly will, beleeve, and practise the same in my life and conversation [=behaviour], and evermore hold fast that blessed hope of everlasting life.

Mortifie and kill all vice in mee, that my life may expresse my faith in thee : mercifully heare the humble suit of thy servant, and grant me thy peace all my dayes : Graciously pardon my infirmities, and defend mee in all dangers of body, goods and name : but most chiefly my soule against all assaults, temptations, accusations, subtill baits, and sleights of that old enemy of mankind, Satan that roaring Lion, ever seeking whom he may devoure.

And here (O Lord) I prostrate with most humble mind, crave of thy divine Majestie, to bee mercifull unto the universall Church of thy Sonne Christ : and specially according to my bounden dutie, beseech thee for his sake to blesse, save, and defend the principall member thereof, thy servant our most deare and Souveraigne Lord King Charles, increase in his Royall heart true faith, godly zeale, and love of the same : And grant him victorie over all his enemies, a long, prosperous, and honourable life upon earth, a blessed end, and life everlasting.

Moreover, O Lord, grant unto his Majesties most honourable Counsailers, and every other member of this Church of England, that they and wee in our severall callings, may truely and godly serve thee : Plant in our hearts true feare and honour of thy Name, obedience to our Prince, and love to our neighbours : Increase in us true Faith and Religion : Replenish our minds with goodnesse, and of thy great mercie keepe us in the same, till the end of our lives : Give unto us a godly zeale in prayer, true humilitie in prosperity, perfect patience in adversity, and continuall joy in the holy Ghost.

And lastly, I commend unto thy Fatherly protection, all that thou hast given me, as wife, children, and servants : Ayd me, O Lord, that I may governe, nourish, and bring them up in thy feare and service. And forasmuch as in this world I must alwayes be at war and strife, not with one sort of enemies, but with an infinite number, not onely with one flesh and blood, but with the devill which is the prince of darknesse, and with which wicked men executors of his most damnable will : Grant me therefore thy grace, that being armed with thy defence, I may stand in the battell with an invincible constancy against all corruption which I am compassed with on every side, untill such time as I having ended the combate, which during this life, I must sustaine, in the end I may attaine to thy heavenly rest, which is prepared for me and all thine Elect, through Christ our Lord and onely Saviour. Amen.

And although we ought at all tymes humbly to knowledge* our synnes before God, yet ought we moste chiefly so to doe, when we assemble and mete toguether, to rendre thankes for the greate benefites that we have received at his handes, to sette furth his moste worthie praise, to heare his moste holye worde, and to aske those thynges whiche be requisite and necessarie, aswel for the bodye as the soule. wherfore I praye and beseche you, as many as be here presente, to accompany me wyth a pure harte and humble voice, unto the throne of the heauenly grace, saying after me.

Spare thou them O God, whiche confesse their faultes. Restore thou them that be penitent, accordyng to thy promises declared unto mankynde, in Christe Jesu our Lorde.

Wherefore we beseche him to graunt us true repentaunce and hys holy spirite, that those thynges may please hym, whych we doe at thys present, and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy so that at the last we may come to his eternall ioye, through Jesus Christe our lorde.

In his hand are al the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hilles is his also.

The Sea is his, and he made it and his handes prepared the drie lande.

O come, let us worshippe and fal doune: and knele before the lorde our maker.

For he is the Lord our god: and we are the people of his pasture, and the shepe of his handes.

To day if ye wyl heare his voyce, harden not your hartes: as in the provocacion, and as in the daie of temptacion in the wildernesse.

When your fathers tempted me : proved me, and sawe my workes.

Fortie yere long was I greved with this generacion, and saide: it is a people that doe erre in their hartes: for they have not knowen my wayes.

Unto whom I sware in my wrath that the shoulde not enter into my rest.

THE FOURME OF

SOLEMPNIZACION OF MATRIMONYE.





FIRST, the banes [banns] must be asked thre severall Sondaies or holy daies, in the tyme of service, the people beyng present, after the accustomed maner.

And yf the persons that would be maryed dwell in diverse Paryshes, the banes must be asked in both Parishes and the Curate of the one Paryshe shall not solempnize matrimonye betwyxt them, wythout a certifycate of the banes beyng thryse asked, from the Curate of the other Parysh. At the date appoincted for solempnizacyon of Matrimonye, the persones to be maryed shal come into the body of the Churche, wyth theyr frendes and neighbours. And there the Pryest shall thus saye.

DEARELY beloved frendes, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of his congregacion, to joyne together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable state, instytuted of God in Paradise, in the time of manes innocencie, signiflyng unto us the mistical union that is betwixt Christ and his Churche: which holy state Christe adourned and beautified with his presence and firste myracle that he wrought in Cana of Galile, and is commended of sainct Paul to be honourable emong all men, and therfore is not to be enterprised, nor taken in hande unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly, to satisfye mennes carnall lustes and appetytes, lyke brute beastes that have no understandyng ; but reverently, discretely, advisedly, soberly, and in the feare of God, duely consideryng the causes for the which matrimony was ordeined. One was the procreation of children, to be brought up in the feare and nurtoure of the Lorde, and praise of God. Secondly, it was ordeined for a remedy agaynste sinne and to avoide fornication, that suche persones as have not the gifte of continencie might mary, and kepe themselves undefiled membres of Christes body. Thirdly, for the mutual societie, helpe, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, bothe in prosperity and adversitye, into the whiche holy state these two persones present, come nowe to be joyned. Therefore if any man can shewe any just cause, why thei may not lawfully be joyned together let hym now speake, or els hereafter for ever holde his peace.

And also speakynge to the persons that shalbe maryed, he shall sale.

I REQUIRE and charge you (as you wil aunswere at the dreadful day of judgement, when the secretes of all hartes shalbe disclosed) that if either of you doe knowe any impedyment, why ye may not be lawfully joyned together in Matrimony, that ye confesse it. For be ye well assured, that so many as be coupled together, otherwyse than Goddes worde doeth allowe, are not joyned together by God, neither is their Matrimonye lawfull.

At whyche day of Maryage, if any man do allege and declare any impediment, why they may not be coupled together in matrymony by Gods law, or the lawes of thys realme, and wyll be bound, and sufficient sureties with him to the parties, or els put in a cautyon to the ful value of suche charges, as the persons to be maryed do susteine to prove hys allegation: then the solempnization must be deferred unto suche tyme as the truthe be tried. If no impedyment be alledged, then shall the curate saye unto the man,

N. WILT thou have thys woman to thy wedded wyfe, to lyve together after Goddes ordynaunce in the holye estate of Matrimony? Wylt thou love her, comforte her, honour, and kepe her, in sickenes, and in healthe? And forsakyng al other, kepe the onely to her, so long as you both shall hve?

The man shall aunswere,

I will.

Then shall the Priest saye to the woman,

N. WILT thou have this man to thy wedded housband, to lyve together after Goddes ordynaunce in the holy estate of matrimony? wilt thou obey hym and serve him, love, honour, and kepe him, in sycknes and in health? And forsakynge al other, kepe the onely to him so long as ye bothe shal live

The woman shall aunswere,

I will.

Then shall the Minister saie,

Who geveth this woman to be maried unto this man?

Â¶ And the Minister receivyng the woman at her father or frendes handes, shall cause the man to take the woman by the right hand, and so either to geve their trouth to other, the man first saying.

I N. take the. N. to my wedded wyfe, to have and to hold from thys day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for porer, in sickenes, and in healthe, to love and to cheryshe, tyll death us departe; according to Gods holy ordinaunce, and therto I plight the my trouth.

Then shall they louse their handes, and the woman takyng againe the man by the right hande, shall saie.

I N. take the. N. to my wedded husbande, to have and to holde, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickenes, ad in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us departe, accordynge to godes holy ordinaunce: and therto I geve the my trouth.





Then shall they again louse theyr handes, and the man shal geve unto the woman a ring, laying the same upon the booke, with the accustomed dutie to the Priest and Clerke. And the Priest taking the ryng, shal delyver it unto the man, to put it upon the fourth finger of the womans left hand. And the man taught by the Priest, shal say.

WITH this ring I the wed: with my body I the worship: and with all my worldly goodes, I the endow. In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the man leavyng the ryng upon the fourth finger of the womans left hande, the Minister shall saye.

O ETERNALL God, creatoure and preserver of all mankynd, giver of all spirytuall grace, the aucthour of everlastyng life: send thy blessyng upon these thy servauntes, thys man and this woman, whom we blesse in thy name, that as Isaac and Rebecca lyved faithfully together: So these persons may surely performe and kepe the vow and covenaunt betwixte them made, wherof this ring geven, and received, is a token and pledge, and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together, and live according unto thy lawes, thorough Jesus Christ our Lorde. Amen.

Â¶ Then thai the Priest joyne their right handes together and say.

Those whome God hath joyned together, let no man put a sonder.

Then shall the Minister speak unto the people.

FOR asmuche as .N. and .N. have consented together in holy wedlocke, and have witnessed the same before God, and thys company, and therto have given and pledged, their trouth eyther to other, and have declared the same by gevyyng and receivyng of a ryng, and by joynyng of handes I pronounce that thei be man and wife together. In the name of the father, of the sonne and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

And the Minister shal adde this blessyng.

GOD the Father, God the Sonne, God the holy Ghost, blesse, preserve, and kepe you, the Lorde mercifully wyth his favour loke upon you, and so fil you with al spiritual benediction, and grace, that you may so lyve together in thys life, that in the world to come, you may have life everlastyng. Amen.

Â¶ Then the Ministers or Clerckes goyng to the Lordes table, shall saie, or syng this Psalme folowyng Beati omnes.





BLESSED are all they that feare the Lorde, and walke in his waies.

For thou shalt eate the labour of thy handes, O wel is the, and happy shalt thou be.

Thy wife shalbe as the fruitfull vine upon the walles of thy house.

Thy children like the olive braunches rounde about thy table.

Lo thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the lorde.

The Lorde from out of Sion shal blesse the: that thou shalt see Hierusalem in prosperitie, al thy life long:

Yea, that thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace upon Israel.

Glory be to the. &c.

As it was. &c.



Psal. cxxviii.

Or elles this Psaime folowyng Deus misereatur.

GOD be mercifull unto us and blesse us: and shewe us the lyght of his countenaunce, and be merciful unto us.

That thy waie maie be knowen upon the earth: thy savyng healthe among al nacions.

Let the people prayse the (O God) yea, let all the people praise the.

O let the nacions rejoyce and be glad, for thou shalt judge the folke ryghteously, and governe the nacions upon the earth.

Let the people praise the (O God) lette all the people praise the.

Then shall the earthe bryng furthe her encrease, and God, even our God, shal geve us his blessyng.

God shall blesse us, and al the endes of the worlde shall feare him.

Glory be to the Father. &c.

As it was in the be. &c.

The Psaime ended, and the man and the woman knelyng afore the Lordes table: The Priest standyng at the Table, and turnyng hys face towarde them, shal saie,



Lorde have mercie upon us.

Aunswere. Christe have mercie upon us.

Minister. Lorde have mercie upon us.

OUR FATHER WHICHE ART. &c.

And leade us not into temptation.

Aunswere. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Minister. O Lorde, save thy servaunt, and thy handmaide.

Aunswere. Whyche put their trust in the.

Minister. O Lorde sende them helpe from thy holy place.

Aunswere. And evermore defende them.

Minister. Be unto them a towre of strength.

Aunswere. From the face of their enemie.

Minister. O Lorde heare our praier.

Aunswere. And let our crie come unto the.

Â¶ The Minister.

O GOD of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, blesse these thy servauntes, and sowe the sede of eternal life in their mindes, that whatsoever in thy holy worde they shal profitably learne, they may in dede fulfil the same. Loke, O Lorde mercifully upon theim from heaven, and blesse them. And as thou diddest send thy blessing upon Abraham and Sara to their greate comforte: so vouchesaufe to sende thy blessing upon these thy servauntes, that they obeiyng thy will, and alway beyng in saufetie under thy protection, may abide in thy love unto their lives ende, throughe Jesu Christe our Lorde. Amen.

Â¶ This prayer next folowyng shal be omitted where the woman is past chide birth.

O MERCIFULL Lorde, and heavenly Father, by whose gracious gifte mankynde is encreased, we beseche the assiste with thy blessyng these two persones, that they may bothe be fruitefull in procreation of children, also live together so long in godly love and honestie, that they may see their childers children, unto the thirde and fourthe generacion unto thy praise and honour: through Jesus Christe our Lorde. Amen.

O GOD whiche by thy mightie power hast made all thinges of naught, which also after other thinges set in ordre, diddest appoinct that out of man (created after thyne owne ymage and similitude) woman should take her beginning, and knitting them together, diddest teache that it shoulde never be lawfull to put a sonder those, whome thou by matrimonie haddest made one: O God which haste consecrated the state of matrimonie to suche an excellent misterie, that in it is signified and represented the spiritual mariage and unitie betwixte Chniste and his Churche: Loke mercifully upon these thy servauntes, that both this man may love his wife, accordyng to thy worde (as Christe did love his spouse the Churche, who gave himselfe for it, lovyng and cherishing it, even as his owne fleshe). And also that this woman may be lovyng and amiable to her housband as Rachel, wise as Rebecca, faithfull and obedient as Sara, and in all quietnes, sobrietie, and peace, be a folower of holy and Godly matrones, O Lorde blesse them bothe, and graunt them to enherite thy everlastyng kyngdome: throughe Jesus Christe our Lorde. Amen.

Â¶ Then shall the Priest saye,

ALMIGHTIE God, which, at the beginnyng did create our firste parentes Adam and Eve, and did sanctifie and joyne them together in mariage, powre upon you the richesse of his grace, sanctifie, and blesse you, that ye may please hym both in body and soule, and live together in holy love, unto your lives ende. Amen.

Then shal begyn the Communion, and after the Gospel shalbe saied a Sermon, wherin ordinarily (so oft as there is any mariage) thoffice of a man and wife shalbe declared, accordyng to holy Scripture, or if there be no sermon, the Minister shal reade this that foloweth.

AL ye which be maried, on whiche entend to take the holy estate of Matrimonie upon you: heare what holy scripture doth say, as touching the dutie of housbandes towarde their wives, and wives toward their housbandes.

Saincte Paul (in his Epistle to the Ephesians, the v Chapiter) doeth geve this commaundement to all maried men.

Ye housbandes love your wives, even as Christ loved the Churche, and hath geven hymselfe for it, to sanctifie it, purgyng it in the fountaine of water, throughe the worde, that he might make it unto hym selfe a glorious congregacion, not havyng spot or wrincle, or any suche thyng, but that it shoulde be holy and blameles. So men are bounde to love their owne wyves, as their owne bodies. He that loveth his owne wife loveth hym selfe. For never did any man hate his owne fleshe, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Londe doeth the congregacion, for we are membres of his body: of his flesh and of hys bones.

For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shalbe joined unto his wife, and thei two shalbe one flesh. This mistery is great, but I speake of Christe and of the congregacion. Neverthelesse, let every one of you so love his owne wyfe, even as hym selfe.



Psal. lxvii.



Likewise the same sainct Paule (wrytyng to the Collossians) speaketh thus to all men that be maried. Ye men, love your wyves, and be not bitter unto them.

Collos iii.

Heare also what saincte Peter Thaposthe of Christe, whiche was him selfe a maried man (saith unto al men) that are maried. Ye housbandes, dwel with your wyves according to knowledge. Gevynge honour unto the wyfe as unto the weaker vessell, and as heires together of the grace of lyfe, so that your praiers be not hyndred.

Hetherto ye have hearde the dutie of the housbande toward the wyfe.

Now likewise ye wyves heare and learne your dutie towarde your housbandes, even as it is plainely sette furth in holy scripture.



i. Pet. iii.

Saincte Paule (in the forenamed Epistle to the Ephesians) teacheth you thus: Ye women, submit youre selfes unto youre owne housbandes as unto the Lorde: for the housbande is the wyves headde, even as Christe is the headde of the Churche. And he is also the savioure of the whole bodye. Therefore as the Churche or congregacion, is subjecte unto Christe. So likewyse lette the wyves also be in subjection unto their owne housbandes in al thinges. And againe he sayeth : Let the wife reverence her housbande. And (in his Epistle to the Collossians) Sayncte Paule geveth you thys shorte lesson, Ye wyves submitte youre selves unto youre own housbandes, as it is convenient in the Lorde.

Ephe. v.





Col. iii.



Saincte Peter also doeth instructe you verye godly, thus saiynge, Let wyves be subject to their owne housbandes, so that if anye obey not the woorde, they may be wonne withoute the woorde, by the conversacion [=behavior] of the wyves, whyle they beholde your chaste conversacion coupled with feare, whose apparell let it not be outward, with broided [braided] haire and trymmyng about with golde, eyther in puttinge on of gorgeous apparell, but let the hidde manne whiche is in the harte, be without all corruption, so that the spirite be milde and quiete, whiche is a precious thynge in the sighte of God. For after thys maner (in the olde tyme) did the holy women whiche trusted in God apparell them selves, beynge subject to their owne housbandes, as Sara obeyed Abraham callyng hym Lorde; whose daughters ye are made, doynge well, and beyinge not dismayde with any feare.

The newe maried persones (the same day of their mariage) must receyve the holy Communion.

i. Pet. iii.

Â¶ THE ORDER FOR THE

VISITACION OF THE SICKE.



The Priest entryng into the sicke persones house, shall saye.

Peace be in* this house, and to all that dwel in it.

When he commeth into the sicke mannes presence, he shall saye knelynge doune.

REMEMBRE not Lorde oure iniquities, nor the iniquities of our forefathers. Spare us good Lorde, spare thy people, whome thou hast redemed with thy most precious bloude and bee not angry with us for ever.

Lorde have mercy upon us.

Christe have mercy upon us.

Lorde have mercy upon us.

Â¶ Our father whiche art in heaven. &c

And leade us not into temptacion.

Aunswere. But deliver us from evel. Amen.

Â¶ Minister. O Lorde save thy servaunt.

Â¶ Aunswere. Whiche putteth his trust in the.

Â¶ Minister. Sende him helpe from thy holy place.

Â¶ Aunswere. And evermore myghtely defende him.

Â¶ Minister. Let the enemy have none advauntage of him.

Â¶ Aunswere. Nor the wicked approche to hurte him.

Â¶ Minister. Be unto him O Lorde a strong Towre.

Â¶ Aunswere. From the face of his enemy.

Â¶ Minister. Lorde heare our praiers.

Â¶ Aunswere. And let our crie come unto the.

Â¶ Minister,

O Lorde loke doune from Heaven, beholde, visite, and releve this thy servaunt. Loke uppon him with the eies of thy mercye, geve him comforte and sure confidence in the, defende him from the daunger of the enemy, and kepe him in perpetual peace, and saufety: Through Jesus Christe our Lorde. Amen.

HEARE us almighty, and most mercifull God, and saviour, extend thy accustomed goodnes, to this thy servaunt whiche is greved with syckenesse, visit him O Lorde, as thou diddest visit Peters wifes mother, and the capiteines servaunt. So visit and restore unto this sicke person his former health (if it bee thy wil) or els geve him grace so to take thy visitation, that after this painful life ended, he may dwell with the in life everlastyng. Amen.

Â¶ Then shal the Minister exhorte the sicke person after this forme or other lyke.





* "to" in early 1600's.



DERELY beloved know this, that almighty god is the lorde of life and death, and over al thinges to theym perteinyng, as youthe, strength, helthe, age weaknesse, and sicknes, wherfore, whatsoever your syckenesse is, knowe you certainlye, that it is Goddes visitacion. And for what cause soever this sicknes is sent unto you: whether it bee to trie youre patience for the example of other, and that your faith may be founde in the dai of the lord laudable, glorious, and honorable, to the encrease of Glory, and endles felicitie: Or els it be sent unto you, to correct, and amende in you whatsoever dothe offende the eies of our heavenly father: knowe you certeinly, that yf you truly repent you of your sinnes, and beare your sickenes patiently, trustyng in Gods mercy for his dere sonne Jesus Christes sake, and rendre unto him humble thankes for his fatherly visitacion, submittyng your selfe wholly to his will, it shall turne to your profite, and helpe you forwarde in the right waye that leadeth unto everlastyng life*. Take therfore in good worthe, the chastemente of the lord, for whom the lord loveth he chastiseth. yea, as S. Paul saith, he scourgeth every sonne which he receiveth : If you endure chastisement, he offereth himself unto you as unto his own children. What sonne is he that the father chastiseth not? If ye be not under correction (whereof all true children are partakers) then are ye bastardes, and not children. Therfore seying, that when our carnal fathers do correct us, we reverently obey them, shal we not now muche rather be obedient to our spirituall father, and so live? And they for a few daies do chastise us after their owne pleasure, but he doth chastise us for our profit to thentent he maye make us partakers of his holines. These wordes good brother, are Gods wordes, and written in holy Scripture for our comforte and instruction, that we sholde paciently and with thankesgeving, beare our heavenly fathers Correction, whensoever by any maner of adversitie it shal please his gratious goodnes to visite us. And there shoulde be no greater comforte to christien persons, than to be made like unto christ, by sufferyng patiently adversities, troubles, and Sickenesses. For he him selfe went not up to joye, but firste he suffered paine : hee entred not into his glorye, before he was crucified: So truly our way to eternall joye, is to suffer here with Christe, and our doore to entre into eternall life: is gladly to die with Christ, that we may ryse againe from death and dwell with him in everlastynge life. Nowe therfore, taking your sickenesse, whiche is thus profitable for you paciently: I exhorte you in the name of God, to rernembre the profession whiche you made unto God, in your Baptisme. And forasmuche as after this lyfe there is accompte [account] to be geven unto the rightuous judge, of whome all must be judged without respect of persons: I require you to examine your selfe and your state, bothe towarde God and man, so that accusynge and condempning your self for your owne faultes, you may fynde mercy at our heavenly fathers hande, for Christes sake, and not be accused and condempned in that fearful judgement. Therfore I shal shortly rehearse the Articles of our faith, that ye may know whether you do beleve as a Christien man shoulde, or no.

Â¶ Here the minister shall rekerse the articles of the faith saieng thus DOEST thou beleve in God the father almighty.

And so furth, as it is in Baptisme.

1559:





*If the person visited be very sicke then the Curate may ende his exhortacion in thys place.



Â¶	Then shal the minister examine whether he be in charitie, with all the worlde: exhortyng hym to forgive from the botome of his hart, al persons that have offended hym, and if he have offended other, to aske them forgevenesse; And wher he hathe done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amendes to the uttermost of his power. And if he have not afore disposed his goodes, let him the make his wil. (But men must be oft admonished that they set an order for their temporall goodes and landes,when they be in health.) And also declare his debtes, what hee oweth, and what is owyng unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietnes ofhis executours. The minister may not forget, nor omitte to move the sicke person (and that most earnestly) to liberalitie lowarde the poore.

From late 1500's:



This may be done before the minister begin his praiers as he shal se cause.



Â¶	Then shal the minister examine whether he be in charitie, with all the world, exhorting him to forgive from the bottome of his heart all persons that have offended him, and if he have offended other, to aske them forgevenesse: and where hee hath done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amends to the uttermost of his power. And if he have not afore disposed his goods, let him the make his will, and also declare his debts, what he oweth, and what is owing unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietnesse of his Executors. But men must be oft admonished that they set an order for their temporall goods and lands, when they be in health.

Â¶	These words before rehearsed, may bee said before the Minister begin his praier, as he shall see cause.

Â¶	The minister may not forget, nor omit to moove the sicke person (and that most earnestly) to liberality loward the poore.

Â¶	Here shall the sicke persone make a speciall confession, if he feele hys conscience troubled with any weighty matter. After whiche confession the priest shall absolve him after this sorte.

OUR Lorde Jesus Christ who hath left power to hys Churche to absolve all sinners, whiche truly repente, and beleve in him: of hys greate mercie forgeve thyne offences, and by his aucthoritie committed to me, I absolve the from al thy synnes. In the name of the father and of the sonne &c. Amen.

Â¶ And then the priest shal say the Collect folowyng.

Â¶ Let us praie.

O MOST merciful God, whiche according to the multitude of thy mercies, dost so put awai the sinnes of those whiche truly repent, that thou remebrest them no more, open thy eie of mercy upon this thy servaunt, who most earnestly desireth pardon, and forgevenes. Renue in him most lovying father, whatsoever hath been decaied, by the fraud, and malice of the devel, or by his owne carnall will, and frailnes, preserve, and continue this sicke membre in the unitie of thy churche, consider his contricion, accept hys teares, asswage his paine, as shalbe sene to thee most expedient for him. And forasmuche as he putteth his full trust only in thy mercy, impute not unto him his former sinnes, but take him to thy favour, through the merites of thy moste derely beloved sonne Jesus Chriest. Amen.

Â¶ Then the Minister shal saie this Psalm.





IN the, O Lorde have I put my trust, let me never bee put to confusion, but ridde me, and deliver me into thy ryghtuousnesse, encline thine eare unto me and save me.

Be thou my strong holde wherunto I may alway resorte: thou hast promysed to helpe me, for thou art my house of defence, and my Castel.

Deliver me a my God out of the hande of the ungodly: out of the hande of the unrightuous and cruell man.

For thou O lorde God art the thyng that I long for : thou art my hope even from my youth.

Through the have I ben holden up ever sence I was borne: thou art he that toke me out of my mothers wombe, my prayse shall alway be of the.

I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure truste is in the.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: (that I may sing of thy glory) and honor all the daie longe.

Cast me not away in the tyme of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth me.

For myne enemies speake againste me, and they that laye wayte for my soule, take their counsail together, saiynge: God hath forsaken hym, persecute hym, and take hym, for there is none to deliver hym.

Go not farre from me, O God: my God, haste the to helpe me.

Let them be confounded and perishe, that are against my soule: let them be covered with shame and dishonoure that seke to do me evill.

As for me, I will pacietly abide alwaie : and wil praise the, more and more.

My mouthe shall dayely speake of thy righteousnes, and salvacion: for I knowe no ende therof.

I will go furth in the strength of the Lorde God: and will make mencion of thy righteousnesse onely.

Thou (O God) haste taughte me from my youthe up untill nowe: therefore I will tell of thy wonderous workes.

Forsake me not (O God) in myne olde age, when I am gray headed: until I haue shewed thy strength unto this generacion, and thy power to all them that are yet for to come.

Thy righteousnesse (O God) is very hygh, and great thinges are they that thou haste done: O God, who is lyke unto the?

O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me? and yet diddest thou turne and refreshe me, yea, and broughtest me from the depe of the earth agayne.

Thou hast broughte me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.

Therfore will I prayse the and thy faythefulnes (O God) plaiynge upon an instrument of Musicke: unto the will I synge uppon the Harpe, O thou holy one of Israell.

My lippes will be faine, when I sing unto the: and so will my soule whome thou hast delivered.

My tongue also shal talke of thy righteousnesse al the day long : for thei are confounded and brought unto shame, that seke to do me evill.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghoste.

As it was in the begynnynge, is nowe and ever shalbe worlde without ende. Amen.

Addyng thys.

O SAVIOUR of the worlde, save us, whyche by thy crosse and precious bloude hast redemed us, helpe us we beseche the, O God.

Â¶ Then shal the Minister saye.

THE almightie Lord; whiche is a moste strong tower to all them that put their trust in him, to whom all thinges in heaven, in earthe, and under the earthe doe bowe and obey, be now; and evermore thy defence, and make the knowe and fele, that there is no other name under heaven geven to man, in whome, and throughe whome thou mayest receyve healthe and salvacion, but onely .the name of oure Lorde Jesus Christe. Amen.

Â¶ THE



COMMUNION OF THE SICKE.

Forasmuche as al mortal men be subjecte to many soubdein perilles, diseases, and sicknesses, and ever uncertaine what time they shal departs out of this lyf. Therfore to thentent they may be alwaies in a readines to die, whensoever it that please Almightie God to cal them: The Curates shal diligently from tyme to tyme, but specially in the plague time, exhort their Parishioners to the oft receivyng in the Churche, of the holy Communion of the body and bloude of our saviour Christ. Whiche (if thei do) thei shal have no cause in their soubdeine visitation to be unquieted for lacks of the same. But if the sicke persons be not able to come to the Churche, and yet is desirous to receive the Communion in his house, then yee must give knowledge over night, or elles early in the Morning to the Curate, signifying also how many be appoincted to communicate with him. And havyng a convenient place in the sicke mans house, where the Curate may reverently minister, and a good nomber to receive the Communion with the sicke persons, with all thynges necessary for the same, he that there minister the holy Communion.

The Collect.

ALMIGHTIE everlivyng God, maker of mankynde, whiche doest correcte those whom thou doest love, and chastisest every one whome thou doest receive, we beseche the to have mercie upon this thy servaunt visited with thy hande, and to graunt that he may take his sickenesse paciently, and recover his bodily helth (yf it be thy gracious wil), and whensoever his soule shal depart from the body, it may bee without spot presented unto the: Throughe Jesus Christe our Lorde. Amen.





The Epistle.

MY sonne, despise not the correction of the Lorde, neither faint when thou art rebuked of hym. For whome the Lorde loveth, him he correcteth : yea, and he scourgeth every sonne whom he receiveth.





Hebr. xii.



The Gospel.

VERELY, verely I say unto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleveth on hym that sent me, hath everlastyng life, and shall not come unto dampnacion, but he passeth from death unto lyfe.

Â¶	At the time of the distribucion of the holy Sacrament, the Priest shal flrst receive the Communion hymselfe, and after minister unto them that be appoincted to communicate with the sicke.

Â¶	But if any man, either by reason of extremitie of sickenes, or for lacke of warnyng in due time to the Curate, or for lacke of company to receive with hym, or by any other just impediment, do not receive the Sacrament of Christes body and bloud, then the Curate shall instruct hym, that if he do truely repent hym of his synnes, and stedfastly beleve that Jesus Christe hath sufred death upon the crosse for him, and shed his bloud for his redempcion, earnestly remembryng the benefites he hath therby, and geving him hartie thankes therfore, he doth eate and dryncke the body and blonde of our saviour Christe, profitably to his soules health, although he doe not receive the Sacrament with his mouthe.

Â¶	When the sicke person is visited, and receiveth the holy Communion al at one time, then the Priest, for more expedicion, shal cut of the fourme of the visitacion at the Psaime, In the, O Lorde have I put my trust, and go streight to the Communion.

Â¶	In the time of plague, Swette, or such other like contagious tymes of sickenesses or diseases, when none of the Paroshe or neighbours can be gotten to communicate with the sicke in their houses, for feare of the infection, upon speciall request of the diseased, the minister may alonly communicate with hym.

The collects and Bible readings for Holy Communion in the 1549, 1552, and 1559 Books of Common Prayer are, with some small exceptions, all identical among those three editions, and so are all given here together. The major difference is that only the 1549 Book has the Introit (or Psalm) appointed for each Sunday and Holy Day; this is omitted in the other books. Also, only the 1549 book has readings appointed for Matins (Morning Prayer) and Evensong (Evening Prayer) for certain Sundays and Holy Days; these are given in the Kalendar for the other books.

The translation used is that of the Great Bible (a portion of which is pictured below), the first authorized English translation. This translation, compiled by Miles Coverdale, was closely based on the very first printed English translation, that of Tyndale. While the Epistles and Gospels were replaced by the "Authorized", or King James version for the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the Psalms given here, as translated by Coverdale, continued to be used in all editions of the Book of Common Prayer through the U. S. 1928 edition.
