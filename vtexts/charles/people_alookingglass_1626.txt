A Looking-glasse,
For Murderers and Blasphemers; wherein they [?]
Gods judgement shown upon a Keeper near Enfield C[hase]
desperately shot at [a] [M]an that intended to have stolen Dear, [?]
This was done on Monday night, the xii. day of June, being the same da[y] [?]
Tempest was in London. To the Tune of Jasper Cunningha[m]
YOu desperate Swearers,
     and foul Blasphemers all,
Give ear unto an accident,
     which lately did befall,
Upon a wicked Keeper,
     God did his Judgement show,
Near to the Chase of Enfield,
     as many People know.

Then lend attention
     to that which I repeat,
Wherein you may admire
     Gods judgements wondrous great,
And learn blasphemous Swearing
     to fl[e]e, for God says plain,
He will not hold him guiltless
     that takes his Name in vain.

Now to my Story
     I come with trembling fear,
A lewd ungodly Liver
     one night was stealing Dear:
The Keepers that with vigilance
     there nightly round did keep,
Upon this Venson-stealer
     most subtly did creep.

And having him encompassed,
     he could not escape away,
One Keeper to an other
     in desperate wise did say,
Now will I shoot this Fellow,
     according to the Law,
And thereupon, his Crosse-bowe
     he suddenly did draw.

The other being mild[r]
     did seek to turn his [?]
And said let us not kill [?]
     some other course we[?]
Here will we apprehen[d]
     for this his lawless dee[d] [?]
That by the course of [?]
     Law may on him pro[?]

The other being grace[?]
     and given un[to] strife, [?]
Said, if he b[?] Dee[?]
     or Man, Isle [ha]ve his [?]
This is my resolution [?]
     at him I mean to sh[?]
And therefore to dissw[ade]
     alas it is no boot.

With those blasphemo[us] [?]
     his Crosse-bowe up h[?]
And aimed at the Fell[low]
     whose breast with for[?]
And him of Life depri[ved]
     but mark the power [?]
Who at that instant se[?]
     did scourge him with [?]

For to this instant tim[?]
     he in that place doth f[?]
So holding of his Cro[?]
     within the shooting h[?]
Theirs none that can re[?]
     by any strength or sk[ill]
And as he first stood shoo[?]
     so now he stands st[ill]

The Second Part. To the same Tune.
ALso his wicked
     profane blasphemous tongue,
Which with vile swearing
     had done his Maker wrong,
Out of his mouth now hangs
     that every one may view
How God rewards Blasphemers
     and gives them there due.

One thing is worthy
     to bee observed well,
That at the season
     when this strange thing befell,
A Tempest fell in London
     upon that very day,
And this was done within that night
     as many people say.

If all Blasphemers
     in this kind were served,
Gods holy Precepts
     would better be observed,
But let all men be warned
     to flee this foul offence,
Which doth the Lord to anger
     above all sins licence.

And let all murderers
     be warned by this tale,
For God such foul offences
     to punish will not fail,
Oh doe not seek for vengeance
     which to the Lord belongs,
Who will when he thinks fitting
     revenge his servants wrongs.

Also this is a warning
     for those that live by stealing,
The Lord severely plagueth those
     who live by such false dealing,
As now he hath this wretched Thief
     who died in his sins,
And few that run so vile a race
     a better ending wins.

What ere you be give not your mind
     to live by pilfering theft,
But larne to labour with your hands
     and use some honest shift,
Then God will bless your labours
     what ere you take in hand,
And every thing shall prosper
     as well by sea as land.

In fine, let all bee warned
     at this Gods Judgement shown,
And think if you offend the like
     the case may be your own,
Provoke not God to execute
     his wrath on you for sin,
But by the example of these twain
     to mend your lives begin.
