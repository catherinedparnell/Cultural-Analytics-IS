A Paraphrase upon the Lords Prayer, and the Creed.
IF any be distressed, and fine would gather
Some comfort, let him hasten to
For we of help and hope are all bereaven,
Unless thou succour us,

Thou show mercy there, and for the same
We praise thee, singing
Of our distresses, Lord, cast up the sum,
Show us thy joys, and let

We mortal are, and alter from our birth,
Thou constant art;
Thou made the Earth, Skies, Stars, and Planets seven,
Thy Name be blessed here,

Nothing we have wherewith our debts to pay,
Unless thou give to us,
Wherewith to cloth us, wherewith to be fed,
For without thee we want

We want, but want no sin, for no day passes
But we doe sin:
No man from sin that ever free did live;
Forgive us, Lord, our sins,

If we repent our sins thou ne'er disdain us;
We pardon
Forgive us that is past, and new path tread us;
Direct us always in thy truth,

As thine own people, and thy chosen Nation,
Into all truth, but
Thou that of all good graces art the giver,
[Permit us not to wander,

Us from th' assaults of World, of Flesh, of Devill,
So shall thy mercies free]
To these Petitions let both Church and Lay-men
With one consent of voice and heart, say

SInce it be fit that I account should give,
What way unto Salvation
Of my profession here the sum I gather,
First I confess a faith

In God who without helper or partaker,
Was of himself the Worlds
And first gave time his being, who gave breath,
To all the creatures

Our everlasting welfare doth consist,
In his great mercies,
The second person of that three in one,
The Fathers elect, and

That ever blessed and incarnate Word,
Which our Redeemer is, our life,
For why? by Satins guile we were deceived,
Christ was that means of help,

Yea when we were in danger to be lost,
Conceived for us
And that we might not ever be forlorn,
For our eternal safety he was

Borne as a man, that man might not miscarry,
Even of the substance
And lo a greater mercy and a wonder,
He that can make all suffer

The Jewish spite, which all the world reviled at,
And Romish tyrannies of
In him I doe believe who was envied,
Who with extremest hate

OUr Father,
--- which art in Heaven,
--- hallowed be thy Name:
--- thy kingdom come:
--- thy will be done on earth,
--- as it is in heaven:
--- give us this day
--- our daily bread:
--- forgive us our trespasses,
--- as we forgive
--- them their trespasses against us:
--- and lead us
--- not into temptation
[--- but deliver
--- us from all evill.]
--- Amen.

I Believe
--- in God the Father
--- Almighty maker
--- both of heaven and earth:
--- and in Jesus Christ
--- his only Son,
--- our Lord,
--- which was conceived
--- by the Holy Ghost,
--- borne
--- of the Virgin Mary,
--- suffered under
--- Pontius Pilot,
--- was crucified,

Who being life itself, to make assured
Our souls of safety, was both
And that no servile fear in us might dwell,
To conquer

Where no infernal power had power to lay
Command upon him, but on
The force of death and hell he did constrain,
And so in Triumph

Yea the Almighty power advanced his head,
As well above all things as
Then that from thence gifts might to men be given,
With glory

Where that supreme and everlasting Throne,
Which was prepared, he climbed
That blessed seat where he shall make abode,
To plead for us at

And no where should he be enthroned rather,
Then there, for he is God as is
And therefore with an equal love delight I,
To praise and serve them both as one

Yet in their office there's a difference,
And I believe that Jesus Christ
Shall in that great and universal doom,
Return, and that with Angels

To question such as at his Empire grudge,
Even those that have presumed him
And that black day shall be so Catholic[,
As I beleeve not only that

Shall to that grand Assize be summoned,]
But he will both adjudge them
Moreover in the Godhood I conceive,
Another Person in whom

For all my hope and blessedness were lost,
If I beeleeve not
Although vain Schismatics through pride and folly
Contemn her power, I doe believe

Chaste Spouse of Christ, for whom so many search,
By marks uncertain, the true
I doe believe, God keep us in this Union,
That there shall be forever

Of Gods elect, and that he still acquaints
His children in the fellowship
Though damned be men's natural condition,
By grace in Christ I look for

Of all my foul misdeeds, for there begins
Deaths end, which is the punishment
Moreover I the Sadducees infection
Abhor, and doe believe

Yea though I turn to dust, yet through God I,
Expect a glorious rising
And that exempted from the cares here rife,
I shall enjoy perfection,

That is not subject unto change or wasting,
But ever blessed, and for
This is my joy, which that it fail not when
It most should speed me, let God say

     To whom, that he so much vouchsafe me may,
     Thus as a member of the Church I pray.

--- dead and buried,
--- he descended into hell,
--- the third day
--- he arose again
--- from the dead,
--- he ascended into heaven
--- and sits on,
--- the right hand of God,
--- the Father,
--- Almighty:
--- from thence
--- he shall come
--- to judge
[--- the quicke
--- and the dead:]
--- I doe believe
--- in the Holy Ghost,
--- the holy
--- Catholic Church,
--- the Communion
--- of Saints,
--- the remission
--- of sins,
--- the resurrection
--- of the body,
--- and the life
--- everlasting.
--- Amen.
