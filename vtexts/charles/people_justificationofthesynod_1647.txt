A Justification of the Synod of Zion College, against
those, who say they have sate long, and done nothing.
1
THe Synod who dare to control,
That sit in Zion house,
The people looked for mountains, but,
They have brought forth a mouse:
Each man four shillings hath a day,
And do you think theyl lack ho,
When every man has so much pay,
To drink Wine and Tobacco.
     The Synod have full four years sate
     To find out a Religion,
     Yet to conclude, they know not what,
     They want a new Edition.

2.
Say all wise men, what shall we be,
Brownists, or else Presbyters,
Of the Antinomian Heresy,
Or Independent-Fighters:
Shall we be harmless Adamites,
And wear no clothes upon us,
Or shall we be base Catamites,
And damn Religion from us.
     The Synod have etc.

3.
Shall we be brave Apostolicks,
Or else all turn mad Arrians,
Or shall we leave such cursed tricks
And bee Episcoparians:
Shall wee be of the Sect of Love,
And meet in upper rooms,
And doe as doth the Spirit move,
When as the Sisters comes.
     The Synod have etc.

4.
Or shall we bee, as late we were,
For Government and Order,
And have a King and Monarchy
With Courts, the truth to further:
Shall we have Music now and Copes,
And kneel as we were wonted,
Instead of Presbyterian Popes,
Have Common-Prayer chanted.
     The Synod have etc.

5.
Pray tell us, what you do intend,
For, weed be something fine,
Will you our former errors mend,

Or for one give us twain.
Pray something now unto us show,
Give us the bad, or better:
Or what is old, or what is new,
And each will be your debtor.
     The Synod, etc.

6.
I wonder much, that you should want
Your learning, being huge,
You having that same Usurer,
Ycleped Doctor G------
But he good man is near his end,
The bell now for him toles,
Black-Friers poor have pried for him,
Ere since he sold them coals.
     The Synod, etc.

7.
Methinks, the place should help you make
Some truth for to rely on,
How heavenly King David spake,
When as he dwelt in Zion.
But it may be, in that your place
Things cannot well be scand;
Why then I wish you filled that house
Is in the holy Land.
     The Synod, etc.

8.
The Anabaptists are content
You should sit there for ever,
And say ast please the Parliament,
While they dip in the River:
The Brownists sure well pleased are,
To add unto your pay,
The Familists do domineer,
Because you nothing say.
The Synod have etc.

9.
The Independents do rejoice,
They now have won the field,
They say it is the Armies voice,
The Presbyters must yield:
Now Case must unto Goodwin stoop,
And Salami to Dell,
The Presbyters like rushes droop,
O this is wondrous well.
     The Synod, etc.

10.
Some say, like Tinkers you have dealt,
Who mending of a kettle,
Do make two more then ere were felt,
Or else things will not whittle.
And under a most good pretence,
That we should find much ease,
Religion quite is fled from hence,
Pray cure us this disease.
     The Synod, etc.

11.
Dub-dapper Sydrach Sympfon now
Like unto Simia flickers;
A deep and dread revenge doth vow,
On the Schoolmaster Vicars.
And Edwards, that same Hercules,
Will now write his Gangrene,
And therein praise the Sectaries,
The like was never seen-a.
     The Synod, etc.

12.
The Army swear, they will have none
But Independents sway,
And that the Presbyters each one
In office tother day;
And voted one day, and then nuld,
And then voted again,
Shall all out of the House be pulled,
The others only reign.
     The Synod, etc.

13.
And now farewell O Synod brave,
It is in vain to think,
We a Religion ere shall have,
While that your pockets chink.
Four shillings evry day, besides
Your greazie Benefices,
Makes you to have enlarged sides,
But pulls the truth in pieces.
     The Synod have full four years sate,
     To find out a Religion:
     Yet to conclude they know not what,
     They want a new Edition.
