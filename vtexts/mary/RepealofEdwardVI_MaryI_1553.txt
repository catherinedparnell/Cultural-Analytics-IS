FOr as;much as by diverse and several Acts hereafter mentioned, as well the divine service, & good administration of ye Sacraments, as diverse other matters of religion (which we and our forefathers found in this Church of England to us, left by the authority of the catholic Church) be partly altered and in some part taken from us, and in place thereof new things imagined, and set forth by the said Acts, such as a few of singularity have of them selves devised. Whereof hath ensued amongst us in very short time numbers of divers and strange opinions, & diversities of sects, & thereby grown great unquietness, & much discord, to the great disturbance of the common wealth of this realm, and in very short time like to grow to extreme peril and utter confusion of the same, unless some remedy be in that behalf provided. Which thing all true loving and obedient subjects, ought, and are bounden to foresee and provide to the uttermost of their power.

In consideration whereof, be it enacted and established by the Queens highness, the Lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons in this same present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, that an Act made in ye parliament begone at Westminster the fourth day of November in the first year of the reign of the late king Edward the sixth, and from thence continued to the day of December then next ensuing, that is to say, in the first session of the same parliament, entitled, and Act against such persons as should irreverently speak against the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, commonly called the Sacrament of the alter, and for the receiving thereof in both kinds. And also one other Act in the same session, which is entitled, an Act for the election of Bishops, and what seals and stiles they & other spiritual persons exercising jurisdiction Ecclesiastical should use. And also one other Act made in one other session of the said parliament, holden upon prorogation at Westminster, the fourth day of November, in the second year of the reign of the said late king Edward the sixth, and there continued and kept to the day of March in the third year of the said late kings reign, entitled, an Act for the uniformity of service, and administration of the Sa+cramentes, throughout the realm. And also one other Act made in the session last before mentioned, which is entitled, an Act to take away all positive laws, made against the marriage of priests. And also one other Act, made in one other session of the said parliament, holden upon prorogation at Westminster the fourth day of November, in the third year of the reign of the said late king Edward the sixth, and there continued, and kept to the first day of Febru+ary in the fourth year of his reign, entitled, an Act for the abolishing and putting away of divers books and images. And also one other Act made in the same session last before mentioned, entitled, an Act made for the ordering of the Ecclesiastical ministers. And also one other Act made in one other session of the said parliament, holden upon prorogation at Westminster the day of January in the fifth year of the reign of the said late king Edward the sixth, and there continued and kept, till the day of April. in the sixth year of the reign of the said late king, entitled, an Act for the uniformity of common prayer, and the administration of the Sacraments. And one other Act, made in the same last session, entitled, an Act for the keeping of holy days and fasting days. And one other Act made in the session last recited, entitled, an Act made for the declaration of a Statute made for the marriage of priests, and for the le|gittimation of their childrenÂ· and every clause, sentence, branch, article, and articles, mentioned, expressed, or contained in the said Estatutes, and in every of them shall be from henceforth utterly repelled, void, annhilate, and of none effect, to all purposes, constructions, and intents, any thing or things, contained or specified in the said Estatutes, or any of them to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all such divine service and administration of Sacraments, as were most commonly used in the realm of England, in the last year of the reign of our late Sovereign Lord, king Henry the eighth, shall be from, and after the day of December, in this present year of our Lord God, a thousand, five hundred, fifty and three, used and frequented through the hole realm of England, & al other the Queens Majesties dominions. And that no other kind nor order of divine service, nor administration of Sacraments, be after the said twentieth day of December, used or ministered in any other manner, form, or degree within the said realm of England, or other the Queens dominions, then was most commonly used, ministered, and frequented in the said last year of the reign of the said late king Henry the eighth.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no person shall be impeached, or molested in body or goods, for using heretofore, or until the said day of December, the divine service mentioned in the said Acts, or any of them, nor for the using of the old divine service and administration of Sacraments in such manner and form, as was used in ye church of England, before the making of any of the said Acts.


God save the Queen.
