By the Queen,
THe Queens highness well remembering what great inconvenience and dangers have grown to this her highness realm in time past thorough the diversity of opinions, in questions of re|legion, and hearing also that now of late, since the beginning of her most gracious reign, the same contentions be again much renewed thorough certain false and untrue reports and eumors spread by some light and evil disposed persons, hath thought good to do to understand to all her highness most loving and obedient subjects, her most gracious pleasure, in manner and form following.
FIRST her majesty being presently by thonely goodness of God settled in her just possession of thimperiall crown of this realm, and other dominions thereunto belonging, can not now hyde that religion (which GOD and the world knows the hath ever professed from her infancy hitherto) which as her majesty is minded to observe and maintain for her self by gods grace during her time, so doth her highness much desire, and would be glad the same were of all her subjects quietly and charitably embraced. And yet she doth signify unto all her majesties said loving subjects, that of her most gracious disposition and clemency, her highness minds not to compel any her said subjects thereunto, unto such time as further ordre by common assent may be taken therein.

AND furthermore, forasmuch also as it is well known, that sedition and false rumours have been nourished and maintained in this realm, by the subtlety and malice of some euell disposed persons, which take upon them without sufficient auctoritie, to preach, and to interpret the word of GOD, after their own brain, in churches and other places, both public and private. And also by playing of Interludes and printing of false fond books, ballets, rymes, and other lewd treatises in the english tongue, concerning doctrine in matters now in question and controversy, touching the high points and mysteries of christen religion, which books, ballets, rymes, and treatises are chiefly by the Printers and Stacioners set out to sale to her graces subjects, of an evil zeal, for lucre and covetous of vile gain. Her highness therefore straightly charge and commands all and every her said subjects, of whatsoever
