For as;much as diverse light, and sedicious persons, delytyng in continual alterations, and never contented with the present estate, have of late much presumed, and yet cease not to invent, spread, and publish many false, untrue, and vain rumours, and brutes, rashly discoursing upon the great, and most weighty affairs, touching the Queens highness royal person, & state of the realm, contrary to their bound duties of allegiance, & contrary to al good ordre, in such outrageous sort, as (if remedy were not provided in time) great incovenience might ensue. FOR remedy whereof, her highness considering, that of the sufferance of such lewd li|bertie of speaking, evil doings, and attempts, have many times followed, doth therefore straightly charge and command al her loving subjects, of every sort and degree, from henceforth, not only for their own parts to forbear, to publish any such rumours or tales: but also to declare to the next justice of peace, or other officer, any person, whatsoever he be that they shall know to be offenders in this behalf, to the intent, they may (by the said officers) be committed to prison, and further punished by pillory, or otherwise, as the quality of the person, and of his offence may seem to deserve.

AND her highness further pleasure is, that if the hearers of any such light, sediciouse, or naughty talk, spoken in his or their presence, shall not, according to this proclamation, open the same to the next Justice, or other officer, (as aforesaid,) that then the same person, so hearing, and not declaring the same, and being thereof justly convicted, shall be reputed, and taken for the first author of the said rumours, and have such punishment for the same, as the first author should, if he were apprehended.

REQUIRING, and straightly charging and commanding all justices of peace, Mayours, Bailiffs, Sheriffs, Constables, Hedboroughes, & al other her highness officers, and ministers, whatsoever they be, to do their best endeavour, for the effectual execution of this present proclamation, and due punishment of all offend ours in this behalf, as they will answer to the contrary at their perils.


God save the Queen.
