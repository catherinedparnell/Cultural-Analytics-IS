THE PREFACE.

THERE was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which (in continuance of time) hath not been corrupted: as (among other things) it may plainly appear by the Common prayers in the church, commonly called divine service: the first original and ground whereof, if a man would search out by ancient fathers, he shall find that the same was not ordained but of a good purpose, and for a great advancement of godliness. For they so ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greets part thereof) should be red over ones [once] in the year intending thereby, that the clergy and specially such as were Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often reading and meditation of Gods word), be stirred up to godliness themselves, and be more able also to exhort other [others] by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them that were adversaries to the truth. And further that the people (by daily hearing of holy scripture read in the Church) should continually profit more and more in the knowelege of God, and be the more inflamed with the love of his true religion. But these many years passed, this godly and decent ordre of the ancient fathers, hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain Stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vain Repeticions, Commemoracions, and Sinodalles [Synodals], that commonly when any book of the Bible was begone, before three or four Chapiters were red out, al the rest were unredde. And in this sort the book of Essay [Isaiah] was begone in Advent, and the book of Genesis in Septuagesima : but they were only begone, and never red through. After like sort were other books of holy scripture used. And moreover, whereas Saint Paule would have such language spoken to the people in the Church, as they might onderstande, and have profit by hearing the same, the service in this church of England (these many years) hath been red in Latin to the people, which they understood not, so that they have heard with their ears only, and their hearts, spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithstanding that thauncient fathers have divided the Psalms into seven porcions, whereof every one was called a Nocturne, now of late time, a few of them have been daily said (and oft repeated) and the rest utterly omitted. Moreover, the nombre and hardness of the rules, called the Pie, and the manifold changeinges [changes] of the service, was the cause, that to turn the book only, was so harde and intricate a matter, that many times there was more business to find out what should be read, then to read it when it was found out.

These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set furthe such an ordre, whereby the same shall be redressed. And for a readiness in this matter, here is drawn out a kalendre for that purpose, which is plain and easy to be understanden [understood], wherein (so much as may be) the reading of holy scriptures is so set furs, that all things shall be done in ordre, without breaking one piece thereof from another. For this cause be cut of Anthems, Responds, Invitatories, and such like things, as did break the continual course of the reading of the scripture. Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some rules, therefore certain rules are here set furs, which as they be few in nombre, so they be plain and easy to be onderstanden. So that here you have an ordre for prayer (as touching the reading of holy scripture) much agreeable to the mind and purpose of thold fathers, and a great deal more profitable and commodious, then that which of late was used. It is more profitable, because here are left out many things, whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, some vain and superstitious, and is ordained nothing to be read but the very pure word of God, the holy scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language and ordre, as is most easy and plain for the understanding both of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the playnesse of the ordre, and for that the rules be few and easy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the Curates shall need none other books for their public service, but this book, and the Bible, by the means whereof, the people shall not be at so great charge for books, as in time paste they have been.

And where hertofore there hath been great diversity, in saying, and singing in churches within this realm, some following Salisbury use, some Herford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of Lincoln: now from hence furs, all the whole realm, shall have but one use. And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all things must be read upon the book, whereas before by the reason of so often repetition, they could say many things by heart; if those men will weigh their labour, with the profit and knowledge, which daily they shall obtain by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.

And forasmuch as nothing can almost be so plainly set furs, but doubts may rise in the use and practising of the same: To appease all such diversity (if any arise), and for the resolution of all doubts concerning the manner howe to understand, do, and execute the things contained in this book: the parties that so dout [doubt], or diversely take any thing, shall always resort to the Bishop of the diocese, who by his discretion shall take ordre for the quieting and appeasing of the same : so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thing contained in this book. And if the the Bishop of the Diocese be in any doubt, then may he send for the resolution thereof unto the Archbishop.

Though it be appointed in the before written Preface, that all things shall be read and song in the Church, in the English tongue, to the end that the congregacion may bee thereby edified; yet it is not meant, but when men say Morning and Evening prayer privately, they may say the same in any language that they themselves do understand.

And all Priests and Deacons, shall be bound to say daily, the Morning and Evening prayer, either privately or openly, except they be let [=prevented] by preaching, studying of divinity, or by some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministers in every parish Church or Chapel, being at home, and not being otherwise reasonably let [=prevented], shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chapel where he ministers, and shall toll a belle thereto, a convenient time before he begin, that such as be disposed may come to hear Gods word, and to pray with him.

.

The wording of the Preface was changed in a number of minor ways at various times throughout the life of this book.

OF CEREMONIES,



WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED, AND SOME RETAINED.



OF such Ceremonies as be used in the church,and have had their beginning by the institucion of man : Some at the first were of Godly intent and purpose devised, and yet at length, turned to vanity and supersticion : some entered into the Church, by indiscreet devotion and such a zeal as was without knowledge: and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grue daily to more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitablenes, but also because they have much blinded the people, and obscured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and clean rejected. Other there be, which although they have been devised by manne, yet it is thought good, to reserve them still, as well for a decent ordre in the church (for the which they were first devised) as because they pertain to edificacion : whereunto all things done in the Church (as the Apostle teaches) ought to be referred. And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony (in it self considered) is but a small thing : yet the wilful and contempteous transgression, and breaking of a common ordre, and discipline : is no small offence before God.

Let all things be done among you (saith S. Paule) in a semelye and dew ordre. The appoynctment of the which ordre, perteyneth not to private men; therefore no man ought to take in hand, nor presume to appoincte or alter any public or common ordre in Christ's Church, except he be lawfully called and aucthorised thereunto.

And whereas as in this our time, the minds of men are so diverse, that some think it a great matter of conscience, to depart from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies (they be so addicted to their old customs) and again on the other side, some be so new fangled, that they would innovate all thing, and so do despise the old, that nothing can like them, but that is new: it was thought expedient, not so much to have respect how to please and satisfy either of these parties, as how to please God, and profit them both. And yet lest any man should be offended (whom good reason might satisfy) here be certain causes rendered why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some retained and kept still.

Some are put away, because the great excess and multitude of them, bath so increased in these latter days, that the burden of them was intolerable; whereof S. Augustine in his time complained, that they were grow to such a nombre, that the state of christian people was in worse case (concerning that matter) then were the Jewes. And he counselled that such yoke and burden should be taken away, as time would serve quietly to doe it.

But what would saint Augustine have said, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late days used among us? whereunto the multitude used in his time was not to bee compared. This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was so great, and many of them so dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and set furthe Christ's benefits unto us.

And besides this, Christ's Ghospell is not a Ceremonial law (as much of Moses law was) but it is a religion to serve God, not in bondage of the figure, or shadow, but in the freedom of spirit, being content only with those Ceremonies, which doe serve to a decent ordre, and godly discipline, and such as be apt to stir up the dull mind of manne, to the remembrance of his duty to God, by some notable and special significacion, whereby he might be edified.

Furthermore, the most weighty cause of the abolishement of certain Ceremonies was, that they were so far abused, partly by the superstitious blindness of the rude and unlearned, and partly by the unsociable avarice of such as sought more their own lucre, then the glory of God: that the abuses could not well be taken away, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persons, which peradventure will bee offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained still: if they consider, that without some Ceremonies it is not possible to keep any ordre, or quiet discipline in the Church, they shall easily perceive just cause to reform their judugementes. And if they think much that any of the old do remain, and would rather have all devised new: Then such men granting some Ceremonies convenient to be had, surely where the old may be well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove thold only for their age without betraying [betraying] of their own folly. For in such a case, they ought rather to have reverence unto them, for their antiquity, if they will declare themselves to be more studious of unity and concord, then of innovacions and new fanglenesse, which (as much as may bee with the true setting furs of Chrystes Religion) is always to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause with the Ceremonies reserved, to be offended: For as those bee taken away, which were most abused, and did burden men conscionces without any cause: so the other that remain are retained for a Discipline and ordre, which (upon just causes) may bee altered and changed, and therefore are not to be esteemed equal with Gods law. And moreover they be neither dark nor dombe Ceremonies, but are so set furthe, that every manne may understand what they do mean, and to what use they do serve. So that it is not like, that they in time to come, should bee abused, as the other have been. And in these our doings, we condemn no other nations, nor prescribe any thing, but to our awne people only. For wee think it convenient that every country should use such Ceremonies, as they shall think best, to the setting furs of Gods honour, or glory, and to the reducing of the people to a most perfect and Godly living, without error or Supersticion. And that they should put away other things, which from time to time, they perceive to bee most abused, as in men ordinances, it often chances diversely in divers countries.

THE PREFACE.

THERE was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which (in continuance of time) hath not been corrupted: as (among other things) it may plainly appear by the Common prayers in the church, commonly called divine service: the first original and ground whereof, if a man would search out by ancient fathers, he shall find that the same was not ordained but of a good purpose, and for a great advancement of godliness. For they so ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greets part thereof) should be red over ones [once] in the year intending thereby, that the clergy and specially such as were Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often reading and meditation of Gods word), be stirred up to godliness themselves, and be more able also to exhort other [others] by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them that were adversaries to the truth. And further that the people (by daily hearing of holy scripture read in the Church) should continually profit more and more in the knowelege of God, and be the more inflamed with the love of his true religion. But these many years passed, this godly and decent ordre of the ancient fathers, hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain Stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vain Repeticions, Commemoracions, and Sinodalles [Synodals], that commonly when any book of the Bible was begone, before three or four Chapiters were red out, al the rest were unredde. And in this sort the book of Essay [Isaiah] was begone in Advent, and the book of Genesis in Septuagesima : but they were only begone, and never red through. After like sort were other books of holy scripture used. And moreover, whereas Saint Paule would have such language spoken to the people in the Church, as they might onderstande, and have profit by hearing the same, the service in this church of England (these many years) hath been red in Latin to the people, which they understood not, so that they have heard with their ears only, and their hearts, spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithstanding that thauncient fathers have divided the Psalms into seven porcions, whereof every one was called a Nocturne, now of late time, a few of them have been daily said (and oft repeated) and the rest utterly omitted. Moreover, the nombre and hardness of the rules, called the Pie, and the manifold changeinges [changes] of the service, was the cause, that to turn the book only, was so harde and intricate a matter, that many times there was more business to find out what should be read, then to read it when it was found out.

These inconveniences therefore considered, here is set furthe such an ordre, whereby the same shall be redressed. And for a readiness in this matter, here is drawn out a kalendre for that purpose, which is plain and easy to be understanden [understood], wherein (so much as may be) the reading of holy scriptures is so set furs, that all things shall be done in ordre, without breaking one piece thereof from another. For this cause be cut of Anthems, Responds, Invitatories, and such like things, as did break the continual course of the reading of the scripture. Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some rules, therefore certain rules are here set furs, which as they be few in nombre, so they be plain and easy to be onderstanden. So that here you have an ordre for prayer (as touching the reading of holy scripture) much agreeable to the mind and purpose of thold fathers, and a great deal more profitable and commodious, then that which of late was used. It is more profitable, because here are left out many things, whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, some vain and superstitious, and is ordained nothing to be read but the very pure word of God, the holy scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language and ordre, as is most easy and plain for the understanding both of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortness thereof, and for the playnesse of the ordre, and for that the rules be few and easy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the Curates shall need none other books for their public service, but this book, and the Bible, by the means whereof, the people shall not be at so great charge for books, as in time paste they have been.

And where hertofore there hath been great diversity, in saying, and singing in churches within this realm, some following Salisbury use, some Herford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of Lincoln: now from hence furs, all the whole realm, shall have but one use. And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all things must be read upon the book, whereas before by the reason of so often repetition, they could say many things by heart; if those men will weigh their labour, with the profit and knowledge, which daily they shall obtain by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.

And forasmuch as nothing can almost be so plainly set furs, but doubts may rise in the use and practising of the same: To appease all such diversity (if any arise), and for the resolution of all doubts concerning the manner howe to understand, do, and execute the things contained in this book: the parties that so dout [doubt], or diversely take any thing, shall always resort to the Bishop of the diocese, who by his discretion shall take ordre for the quieting and appeasing of the same : so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thing contained in this book. And if the the Bishop of the Diocese be in any doubt, then may he send for the resolution thereof unto the Archbishop.

Though it be appointed in the before written Preface, that all things shall be read and song in the Church, in the English tongue, to the end that the congregacion may bee thereby edified; yet it is not meant, but when men say Morning and Evening prayer privately, they may say the same in any language that they themselves do understand.

And all Priests and Deacons, shall be bound to say daily, the Morning and Evening prayer, either privately or openly, except they be let [=prevented] by preaching, studying of divinity, or by some other urgent cause.

And the Curate that ministers in every parish Church or Chapel, being at home, and not being otherwise reasonably let [=prevented], shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chapel where he ministers, and shall toll a belle thereto, a convenient time before he begin, that such as be disposed may come to hear Gods word, and to pray with him.

.

The wording of the Preface was changed in a number of minor ways at various times throughout the life of this book.

OF CEREMONIES,



WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED, AND SOME RETAINED.



OF such Ceremonies as be used in the church,and have had their beginning by the institucion of man : Some at the first were of Godly intent and purpose devised, and yet at length, turned to vanity and supersticion : some entered into the Church, by indiscreet devotion and such a zeal as was without knowledge: and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grue daily to more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofitablenes, but also because they have much blinded the people, and obscured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and clean rejected. Other there be, which although they have been devised by manne, yet it is thought good, to reserve them still, as well for a decent ordre in the church (for the which they were first devised) as because they pertain to edificacion : whereunto all things done in the Church (as the Apostle teaches) ought to be referred. And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony (in it self considered) is but a small thing : yet the wilful and contempteous transgression, and breaking of a common ordre, and discipline : is no small offence before God.

Let all things be done among you (saith S. Paule) in a semelye and dew ordre. The appoynctment of the which ordre, perteyneth not to private men; therefore no man ought to take in hand, nor presume to appoincte or alter any public or common ordre in Christ's Church, except he be lawfully called and aucthorised thereunto.

And whereas as in this our time, the minds of men are so diverse, that some think it a great matter of conscience, to depart from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies (they be so addicted to their old customs) and again on the other side, some be so new fangled, that they would innovate all thing, and so do despise the old, that nothing can like them, but that is new: it was thought expedient, not so much to have respect how to please and satisfy either of these parties, as how to please God, and profit them both. And yet lest any man should be offended (whom good reason might satisfy) here be certain causes rendered why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some retained and kept still.

Some are put away, because the great excess and multitude of them, bath so increased in these latter days, that the burden of them was intolerable; whereof S. Augustine in his time complained, that they were grow to such a nombre, that the state of christian people was in worse case (concerning that matter) then were the Jewes. And he counselled that such yoke and burden should be taken away, as time would serve quietly to doe it.

But what would saint Augustine have said, if he had seen the Ceremonies of late days used among us? whereunto the multitude used in his time was not to bee compared. This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was so great, and many of them so dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and set furthe Christ's benefits unto us.

And besides this, Christ's Ghospell is not a Ceremonial law (as much of Moses law was) but it is a religion to serve God, not in bondage of the figure, or shadow, but in the freedom of spirit, being content only with those Ceremonies, which doe serve to a decent ordre, and godly discipline, and such as be apt to stir up the dull mind of manne, to the remembrance of his duty to God, by some notable and special significacion, whereby he might be edified.

Furthermore, the most weighty cause of the abolishement of certain Ceremonies was, that they were so far abused, partly by the superstitious blindness of the rude and unlearned, and partly by the unsociable avarice of such as sought more their own lucre, then the glory of God: that the abuses could not well be taken away, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persons, which peradventure will bee offended, for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained still: if they consider, that without some Ceremonies it is not possible to keep any ordre, or quiet discipline in the Church, they shall easily perceive just cause to reform their judugementes. And if they think much that any of the old do remain, and would rather have all devised new: Then such men granting some Ceremonies convenient to be had, surely where the old may be well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove thold only for their age without betraying [betraying] of their own folly. For in such a case, they ought rather to have reverence unto them, for their antiquity, if they will declare themselves to be more studious of unity and concord, then of innovacions and new fanglenesse, which (as much as may bee with the true setting furs of Chrystes Religion) is always to be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause with the Ceremonies reserved, to be offended: For as those bee taken away, which were most abused, and did burden men conscionces without any cause: so the other that remain are retained for a Discipline and ordre, which (upon just causes) may bee altered and changed, and therefore are not to be esteemed equal with Gods law. And moreover they be neither dark nor dombe Ceremonies, but are so set furthe, that every manne may understand what they do mean, and to what use they do serve. So that it is not like, that they in time to come, should bee abused, as the other have been. And in these our doings, we condemn no other nations, nor prescribe any thing, but to our awne people only. For wee think it convenient that every country should use such Ceremonies, as they shall think best, to the setting furs of Gods honour, or glory, and to the reducing of the people to a most perfect and Godly living, without error or Supersticion. And that they should put away other things, which from time to time, they perceive to bee most abused, as in men ordinances, it often chances diversely in divers countries.

* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND CALENDAR

EXPRESSING THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMS AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTS, AS THE RULES FOLLOWING

MORE PLAINLY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

THE ORDER

HOWE THE REST OF HOLY SCRIPTURE (BESIDE THE PSALTER)

IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THOLD Testament is appointed for the first lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read through, every year once, except certain books and Chapiters, which be least edifying, and might best bee spared, and therefore bee left unread.

The new Testament is appointed for the second Lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thryse, beside the Epistles and Gospels: except the Apocalips [=Revelation], out of the which there bee only certain Lessons appointed, upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day: find the day of the month in the Calendar following; and there ye shall perceive the books and Chapiters that shall be read for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to bee noted, that whenever there bee any proper Psalms or Lessons appointed for the Sondayes or for any feast moveable or unmovable: then the Psalms and Lessons, appointed in the calendar shall be omitted for that time.

Ye must note also that the Collect Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the Sunday shall serve al the weke after, except there fall some feast that hath his proper.

This is also to bee noted, concerning the Leap years, that the xxv day of February, which in Leap year is counted for two days, shall in those two days, alter nether Psalm nor Lesson: but the same Psalms and Lessons, which be said the first day, shall also serve for the second day.

Also, wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle or Gospel is not expressed: there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapiter.

And wheresoever is not expressed howe far shall be read, there shall you read to the end of the Chapiter.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND CALENDAR

EXPRESSING THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMS AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTS, AS THE RULES FOLLOWING

MORE PLAINLY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

THE ORDER

HOWE THE REST OF HOLY SCRIPTURE (BESIDE THE PSALTER)

IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THOLD Testament is appointed for the first lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read through, every year once, except certain books and Chapiters, which be least edifying, and might best bee spared, and therefore bee left unread.

The new Testament is appointed for the second Lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thryse, beside the Epistles and Gospels: except the Apocalips [=Revelation], out of the which there bee only certain Lessons appointed, upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day: find the day of the month in the Calendar following; and there ye shall perceive the books and Chapiters that shall be read for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to bee noted, that whenever there bee any proper Psalms or Lessons appointed for the Sondayes or for any feast moveable or unmovable: then the Psalms and Lessons, appointed in the calendar shall be omitted for that time.

Ye must note also that the Collect Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the Sunday shall serve al the weke after, except there fall some feast that hath his proper.

This is also to bee noted, concerning the Leap years, that the xxv day of February, which in Leap year is counted for two days, shall in those two days, alter nether Psalm nor Lesson: but the same Psalms and Lessons, which be said the first day, shall also serve for the second day.

Also, wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle or Gospel is not expressed: there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapiter.

And wheresoever is not expressed howe far shall be read, there shall you read to the end of the Chapiter.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND CALENDAR

EXPRESSING THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMS AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTS, AS THE RULES FOLLOWING

MORE PLAINLY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

THE ORDER

HOWE THE REST OF HOLY SCRIPTURE (BESIDE THE PSALTER)

IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THOLD Testament is appointed for the first lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read through, every year once, except certain books and Chapiters, which be least edifying, and might best bee spared, and therefore bee left unread.

The new Testament is appointed for the second Lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thryse, beside the Epistles and Gospels: except the Apocalips [=Revelation], out of the which there bee only certain Lessons appointed, upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day: find the day of the month in the Calendar following; and there ye shall perceive the books and Chapiters that shall be read for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to bee noted, that whenever there bee any proper Psalms or Lessons appointed for the Sondayes or for any feast moveable or unmovable: then the Psalms and Lessons, appointed in the calendar shall be omitted for that time.

Ye must note also that the Collect Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the Sunday shall serve al the weke after, except there fall some feast that hath his proper.

This is also to bee noted, concerning the Leap years, that the xxv day of February, which in Leap year is counted for two days, shall in those two days, alter nether Psalm nor Lesson: but the same Psalms and Lessons, which be said the first day, shall also serve for the second day.

Also, wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle or Gospel is not expressed: there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapiter.

And wheresoever is not expressed howe far shall be read, there shall you read to the end of the Chapiter.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND CALENDAR

EXPRESSING THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMS AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTS, AS THE RULES FOLLOWING

MORE PLAINLY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

THE ORDER

HOWE THE REST OF HOLY SCRIPTURE (BESIDE THE PSALTER)

IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THOLD Testament is appointed for the first lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read through, every year once, except certain books and Chapiters, which be least edifying, and might best bee spared, and therefore bee left unread.

The new Testament is appointed for the second Lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thryse, beside the Epistles and Gospels: except the Apocalips [=Revelation], out of the which there bee only certain Lessons appointed, upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day: find the day of the month in the Calendar following; and there ye shall perceive the books and Chapiters that shall be read for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to bee noted, that whenever there bee any proper Psalms or Lessons appointed for the Sondayes or for any feast moveable or unmovable: then the Psalms and Lessons, appointed in the calendar shall be omitted for that time.

Ye must note also that the Collect Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the Sunday shall serve al the weke after, except there fall some feast that hath his proper.

This is also to bee noted, concerning the Leap years, that the xxv day of February, which in Leap year is counted for two days, shall in those two days, alter nether Psalm nor Lesson: but the same Psalms and Lessons, which be said the first day, shall also serve for the second day.

Also, wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle or Gospel is not expressed: there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapiter.

And wheresoever is not expressed howe far shall be read, there shall you read to the end of the Chapiter.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

THE TABLE AND CALENDAR

EXPRESSING THE ORDRE OF THE PSALMS AND LESSONS,

TO BEE SAID AT THE MORNING AND EVENING PRAYER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EXCEPT CERTAIN PROPRE

FEASTS, AS THE RULES FOLLOWING

MORE PLAINLY DECLARE.



* * *



THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THE Psalter shall be read through, ones every month, and because that some Months bee longer then some other be; It is thought good, to make them even by this means.

To every month shall be appointed (as concerning this purpose) just xxx days.

And because January and March has one day above the said number, and February, which is placed between them both, hath only xxviii days, February shall borrow of either of the months (of January and March) one day, and so the Psalter, which shall be red in February, must begin the last day of January, and end the first day of March.

And where as May, July, August, October and December, hath xxxi days a piece, it is ordered that the same Psalms shall be red the haste day of the said Months, which were red the day before, so that the Psalter may begin again the first day of the next Month ensuing.

Now to know what Psalms shall be red every day, look in the Calendar, the number that is appointed for the Psalms, and then find the same number in this Table, and upon that number shall you see, what Psalms shall be said at Morning and Evening prayer.

And where the cxix Psalm, is divided into xxii porcions, and is overlong to be red at one time: it is so ordered, that, at one time, shall not be read above four or five of the said porcions, as you shall perceive to be noted in this Table following.

And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in all other parts of the service, where any Psalms are appointed, the nombre is expressed after the great English Bible, which from the ix Psalm, unto the cxlviii Psalm (following the division of the Hebrues) doth vary in nombres from the common Latin translacion.

THE ORDER

HOWE THE REST OF HOLY SCRIPTURE (BESIDE THE PSALTER)

IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.

THOLD Testament is appointed for the first lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read through, every year once, except certain books and Chapiters, which be least edifying, and might best bee spared, and therefore bee left unread.

The new Testament is appointed for the second Lessons, at Morning and Evening prayer, and shall be read over orderly every year thryse, beside the Epistles and Gospels: except the Apocalips [=Revelation], out of the which there bee only certain Lessons appointed, upon diverse proper feasts.

And to know what Lessons shall be read every day: find the day of the month in the Calendar following; and there ye shall perceive the books and Chapiters that shall be read for the Lessons, both at Morning and Evening prayer.

And here is to bee noted, that whenever there bee any proper Psalms or Lessons appointed for the Sondayes or for any feast moveable or unmovable: then the Psalms and Lessons, appointed in the calendar shall be omitted for that time.

Ye must note also that the Collect Epistle and Gospel, appointed for the Sunday shall serve al the weke after, except there fall some feast that hath his proper.

This is also to bee noted, concerning the Leap years, that the xxv day of February, which in Leap year is counted for two days, shall in those two days, alter nether Psalm nor Lesson: but the same Psalms and Lessons, which be said the first day, shall also serve for the second day.

Also, wheresoever the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle or Gospel is not expressed: there ye must begin at the beginning of the Chapiter.

And wheresoever is not expressed howe far shall be read, there shall you read to the end of the Chapiter.

A Brief Declaration

When Every Term Begins

and Ends

[After 1604, this is found at the very end of this section.]

BE it known that Easter Term begins always the eighteenth day after Easter, reckoning Easter Day for one. And ends the Monday next after Ascension Day.

Trinity Term begins always the Friday next after Trinity Sunday and ends the twenty-eighth day of June.

Michaelmas Term begins the ninth or tenth day of October and ends the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth day of November.

Hilary Term begins the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of January and ends the twelfth or thirteenth day of February.

In Easter Term on the Ascension Day, in Trinity Term on the Nativity of Saint John Baptist, in Michaelmas Term on the Feast of All Saints, in Hilary Term on the Feast of the Purification of our Lady, the Queen's judges of Westminster do not use to sit in judgment, nor upon any Sundays.

¶ THE MINISTRACION OF BAPTISM

TO BE USED IN THE CHURCH.

It appears by ancient writers, that the Sacrament of Baptism in the old old time, was not commonly Ministered, but at two times in the year, at Easter and Whytsontide, at which times it was openly ministered in the presence of al the congregacion: which custom (now being grown out of use,) although it can not for many consideracions bee well restored again, yet it is thought good to follow the same as ne'er as conveniently may be. Wherefore the people are to be admonished, that it is most convenient that Baptism should not be ministered but upon Sondayes, and other holy days, when the most nombre of people may come together, as well for that the congregacion there present may testify the receiving of them that be newly Baptised into the number of Christ's Church, as also because in the Baptism of Infants every man present may be put in remembrance of his awne profession made to God in his Baptism. For which cause also, it is expedient that Baptism be ministered in the English tongue. Nevertheless (if necessity so require) children may at al times be Baptised at home.

¶	When there are children to he baptised upon the Sunday, or holy day, the parents shall geve knowledge over night, or in the morning, before the beginning of Morning prayour, to the curate. A nd then the Godfathers, Godmothers, and people with the children, must be ready at the Font, either immediately after the last Lesson at Morning Prayour, or else immediately after the last Lesson at Evening Praiour, as the Curate by his discretion shall appoincte. And then standing there, the Priest shall ask whether the children be Baptised or no. If they answer, No. Then the priest say thus.

DEARLY beloved, forasmuch as al men be conceived and borne in sin, and that our saviour Christ saith, none can entry into the kingdom of God (except he be regenerate, and borne a new of water and the holy gost) I beseech you to cal upon God the father, through our lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy, he will grant to these children, that thing which by nature they can not have, that they may be baptised with water and the holy Ghost, and received into Christ's holy church; and be made lively members of the same.

Then the Priest shall say.

Let us pray.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, which of thy great mercy did save No and his family in the Arcke, from perishing by water, and also did safely lead the children of Israel, thy people, through the red Sea, figuring thereby thy holy Baptism: and by the Baptism of thy well-beloved son Jesus Christ, did sanctify the floude Jordan, and al other waters, to the mistical washinge away of sin: We beseech the (for thine infinite mercies) that thou wilt mercifully loke upon these children, sanctify them and wash them with thy* holy gost, that they being delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the Arcke of Christ's church, and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and roted in charity, may so pass the waves of this troublesome world, that finally they may come to the land of everlasting life, there to reign with the, world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.



* "the" in 1604.





ALMIGHTY and immortal God, the aide of al that need, the helper of al that fly to the for succour, the life of them that believe, and the resurrection of the dead, we cal upon the for these infants, that they, coming to thy holy Baptism, may receive remission of their sins by spiritual regeneracion, receive them (O Lord) as thou haste promised by thy well-beloved son, saying: Ask and you shall have; seek, and you shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you: So geve now unto us that ask. Let us that seek, find open thy gate unto us that knock, that these infants enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which thou haste promised by Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ Then shall the Priest say

Hear the words of the Gospel, written by Saint Mark in the tenth Chapiter.





AT a certain time they brought children to Christ that he should touche them, and his Disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said unto them. Suifre little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; For to such belongs the Kingdom of God. Verily, I say unto you; whosoever doth not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child: he shall not entry therein. And when he had taken the up in his arms: he put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

¶ After the Gospel is red, the minister shall make this brief exhortacion upon the words of the Gospel.

FRIENDS, ye hear in this Gospel the words of our saviour Christ, that he commanded the children to bee brought unto him: howe he blamed those that would have kept them from him, how he exhorted all men to follow their innocence. Ye perceive how by his outward gesture and dede he declared his good will toward them. For he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed them, doubt not you therefore, but earnestly believe that he will likewise favourably receive these present infants, that he will embrace the with the arms of his mercy, that he will geve unto them the blessing of eternal life: and make them partakers of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we being thus persuaded of the good will of our heavenly father, towards these infants declared by his son Jesus Christ, and nothing doubting, but that he favourably allows this charitable work of ours, in bringing these children to his holy Baptism: let us faithfully and devoutly geve thakes unto him, and say

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we geve thee humble thanks, that thou haste vouchedsaufe to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in the, increase this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore: Geve thy holy spirit to these infants, that they may be borne again, and be made heirs of everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ. who lives and reigns with the, and the holy spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

Then the Priest shall speak unto the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this wise:

WELL-BELOVED friends, ye have brought these children here to be baptised, ye have prayed that our lord Jesus christ, would vouchesaufe to receive them, to lay his hands upon them, to bless them, to release them of their sins, to geve them the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life. Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised in his Gospel, to grant all these things that ye have prayed for: which promise he for his part will most surely keep and perform. Wherefore after this promise made by Christ, these infants must also faithfully for their part promise by you that be their sureties, that they will forsake the devil and al his works, and constantly believe Gods holy word, and obediently keep his commandments.

Then shall the Priest demand of the Godfathers and Godmothers these questions.

DOEST thou forsake the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with al covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow, nor be led by them?

Answer. I forsake them al.

The Minister. Doest thou believe in god the father almighty, maker of heave and earth? And in Jesus christ his only begotten son our Lord, and that he was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary: that he suifred under Poncius Pilot, was crucified, dead and buried, that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day: that he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right had of god the father almighty; and from thence shall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead? And doest thou believe in the holy Ghost the holy Catholicque Church, the communion of saints, the remission of sins, the resurreccion of the flesh, and everlasting life after death?

Answer. All this I steadfastly believe.

Ministry. Will thou be baptised in this faith?

Answer. That is my desire.



Mark x.

¶ Then shall the Priest say.

O MERCIFUL God, grant that the old Adam in these children may be so buried, that the new man may be raised up in them. Amen.

Grant that all carnal affeccions may dye in them, and that all things belonging to the spirit may live and grow in them. Amen.

Grant that they may have power and strength to have victory, and to triumph against the Devil, the world, and the flesh. Amen.

Grant that whosoever is here dedicated to thee, by our office and ministry, may also be endued with heavenly virtues, and everlastingly rewarded through thy mercy, O blessed Lord God, who doest live and govern al things world without end. Amen.

ALMIGHTY everliving God, whose most dearly beloved son Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of our sins, did shed out his most precious side both water and blood, and gave commandment to his disciples that they should go teach al nations, and baptise them in the name of the father, the son, and of the holy Ghost : Regard, we beseech the, the supplicacions of thy congregacion, and grant that al thy servants which shall be baptised in this water, may receive the fulness of thy grace, and ever remain in the nombre of thy faithful and elect children, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then the Priest shall take the Child in his hands, and ask the name; and naming the Child, shall dip it in the water, so it be discreetly and warily done, saying,

N. I Baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

¶ And if the Ghilde be weak, it shall suffice to power water upon it, saying the foresaid words.

N. I Baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the Priest shall make a Cross upon the Childes forehead, saying:

WE receive this Child into the congregacion of Christ's flock, and do sign him with the sign of the cross, in token that hereafter he shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner against sin, the world, and the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful soldier and servant unto his lives end. Amen.

Then shall the Priest say,

SAYING now, dearly beloved brethren that these children be regenerate and graffed [grafted] into the body of Christ's congregacion, let us geve thanks unto God for these benefits, and with one accord make our praiours unto almighty God, that they may lead the rest of their life according to this beginning.

Then shall be said.

Our Father which art &c.

Then shall the Priest say,

We yield the hearty thanks most merciful father, that it has pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy holy spirit, to receive him for thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy congregacion. And humbly we beseech thee to grant that he being dead unto sin and living unto righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man, and utterly abolish the whole body of sin, that as he is made partaker of the death of thy son, so he may be partaker of his resurreccion, so that finally with the residue of thy holy congregacion, he may be inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ At the last end, the Priest calling the Godfathers and Godmothers together, shall say this short exhortation following.

FORASMUCH as these children have promised by you to forsake the Devil and his works, to believe in God, and to serve him, you must remember that it is your parts and duties to see that these infants be taught, so soon as they shall be able to learn, what a solemn vow, promise, and profession they have made by you. And that they may know these things the better; ye shall cal upon them to hear Sermons, And chiefly you shall provide that they may learn the Cred, the Lords prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the English tongue; and al other things which a Christian man ought to know and believe to his souls health. And that these children may be virtuously brought up, to lead a Godly and a christian life, remembering always that Baptism doth represent unto us our profession, which is to follow the example of our saviour Christ, and to be made like unto him, that as he died and rose again for us: so should we (which are Baptised) dye from sin, and rise again unto rightuousnes, continually mortifiyng al our evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and godliness of living.

¶	The Minister shall command that the children be brought to the Bishop to be confirmed of him, so soon as they can say in their vulgar tongue the articles of the faith, the Lords prayer, and the x. Commandments, and be further instructed in the Catechism set furs for that purpose, accordingly as it is there expressed.





OF THEM THAT BE

BAPTISED IN PRIVATE HOUSES,

IN TIME OF NECESSITY.

[BY THE LAWFUL MINISTER OF THE PARISH, OR ANY OTHER LAWFUL MINISTER, THAT CAN BE PROCURED.]*



* Added in 1604.





¶	The Pastors and Curates shall oft admonish the people, that they defer not the Baptism of infants any longer then the Sunday, or other holy day, next after the child be borne unless upon a great and reasonable cause declared to the Curate, and by him approved.



1559:

And also they shall warn them that without great cause, and necessity, they baptise not children at home in their houses. And when great need shall compelle them so to doe, that then they minister on this fassion.

First let them that be present cal upon God for his grace, and say the Lords prayour, if the time will sufre. And then one of them shall name the child, and dip him in the water, or power water upon him, saying these words.

1604:

And also they shall warn them, that without great cause and necessity, they procure not their children to be baptised at home in their houses. And when great need shall compel them so to do, that then Baptism shall be administered in this fashion.

First, let the lawful Minister, and them that be present, call upon God for his grace and say the Lord's Prayer, if the time will suffer. And then the child being named by some one that is present, the said lawful Minister shall dip it in water, or pour water upon it, saying these words.





N. I Baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

And let them not doubt, but that the child so Baptised, is lawfully and sufficiently Baptised, and ought not to be Baptised again in the Church. But yet nevertheless, if the child which is after this sort Baptised, do afterward live, it is expediente that he be brought into the Church, to the intent the Priest may examine and try, whether the child be lawfully Baptised or no. And if those that bring any child to the Church do answer that he is already Baptised: then shall the Priest examine them further.





N. I Baptise thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

And let them not doubt, but that the child so Baptised, is lawfully and sufficiently Baptised, and ought not to be Baptised again in the Church. But yet nevertheless, if the child which is after this sort Baptised, do afterward live, it is expediente that he be brought into the Church, to the intent that if the Priest or Minister of the same Parish did himself baptise that child, the Congregation may be certified of the true form of Baptism, by him privately before used: Or if the child were baptised by any other lawful Minister, that then the Minister of the Parish where the child was borne or Christened, shall examine and try whether this child be lawfully baptised, or no. In which case, if those that bring any child to the Church, do answer that the same child is already baptised, then shall the Minister examine them further, saying,





¶ By whom the child was Baptised?

¶ Who was present when the child was Baptised?

¶ Whether they called upon God for grace and succour in that necessity?

¶ With what thing, or what matter they did Baptise the Child?

¶ With what words the child was Baptised?

¶ Whether they think the child to be lawfully and perfectly Baptised?

¶ By whom the child was baptised?

¶ Who was present when the child was baptised?

¶ And because some things essential to this Sacrament may happen to be omitted through fear or haste in such times of extremity; therefore I demand further of you,

¶ With what matter was the child baptised?

¶ With what words was the child baptised?

¶ Whether think you the child to bee lawfully and perfectly baptised?





¶	And if the Minister shall prove* by the answers of such, as brought* the child, that all things were done as they ought to be: Then shall not he Christen the child again, but shall receive him, as one of the flock of the true Christian people, saiynge thus.

I CERTIFY you, that in this case ye have done well*, and according unto due ordre concerning the Baptising of this child, which being borne in Original sin and in the wrath of God, is now by the laver [=water] of regeneracion in Baptism, received into the number of the children of God, and heirs of everlasting life, for our Lord Jesus Christ doth not deny his grace and mercy unto such infants, but most lovingly doth cal the unto him: as the holy gospel doth witness to our comfort on this wise.



* "find" and "bring" in 1604.



* "all is well done" in 1604.



AT a certain time they brought children unto Christ that he should touche them, and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said unto them: Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever doth not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not entry therein. And when he had taken them up in his arms, he put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

¶ After the Gospel is red, the minister shall make this exhortacion upon the words of the Gospel.

FRIENDS, ye hear in this Gospel the words of our saviour Christ, that he commanded the children to bee brought unto him: howe he blamed those that would have kept them from him, howe he exhorted all men to follow their innocence: Ye perceive how by his outward gesture in dede he declared his good will toward them. For he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed them, doubt not you therefore, but earnestly believe, that he hath likewise favourably received this present infant, that he has embraced him with the arms of his mercy, that he hath given unto him the blessing of eternal life, and made him partaker of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we being thus persuaded of the good will of our heavenly father declared by his son Jesus Christ towards this infant, Let us faithfully and devoutly geve thanks unto him, and say the prayer, which the lord him self taught, and in declaration of our faith, let us recite the articles contained in our Cred.

¶ Here the Minister with the Godfathers, and Godmothers shall say.

OUR Father which &c.

¶	Then the Priest shall demand the name of the child, which being by the Godfathers, and Godmothers pronounced, the Minister shall say,

¶ DOEST thou in the name of this child forsfake the devil, and al his works, the vain pomp, and glory of the world, with al the covetous desires of the same, the carnal desires of the flesh, and not to follow and be led by them?

Answer. I forsake them al.

¶ The Minister. Doest thou in the name of this child profess this faith, to believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth And in Jesus Christ his only begotten son our Lord, and that he was conceived by the holy ghost, borne of the virgin Mary: that he suffered under ponce Pilot, was crucified, dead, and buried, that he wet down into hell, and also did rise again the iii day: that he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the father almighty: and from thence he shall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead? And do you in his name believe in the holy gost the holy Catholicque church, the communion of saints, the remission of sins, resurreccion of the flesh, and everlasting life after death?

Answer. All this I steadfastly believe.

Let us pray.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, heavenly father, we geve thee humble thanks, for that thou hast vouchedsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee: increase this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore: Geve thy holy spirit to this infant,that he being borne again and being made heir of everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, may continue thy servant, and attain thy promise, through the same our Lord Jesus Christ thy son, who lives and reigns with the in the unity of the same holy spirit everlasting. Amen.

Then shall the Minister make this exhortacion, to the Godfathers and Godmothers.

FORASMUCH as this child hath promised by you to forsake the devil and al his works, to believe in God, and to serve him: you must remember that it is your part and duty, to see that this infant be taught (so soon as he shall be able to learn) what a solemn vow promise, and profession he hath made by you. And that he may know these things the better, ye shall call upon him to hear sermons. And chiefly ye shall provide that he may learn the Cred, the Lords prayer and the x Commandments in the English tongue, and al other things which a Christian man ought to know, and believe to his souls health, and that this child may be virtuously brought up, to lead a godly, and a christian life. Remembering always that Baptism doth represent unto us our profession, which is to follow the example of our Saviour Christ, and be made like unto him, that as he died and rose again for us, so should we which are Baptised, dye from sin, and rise again unto righteousness, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections, and daily proceeding in al virtue, and godliness of living, etc:

¶ As in Public Baptism.

¶	But if they which bring the infants to the Church, do make an uncertain answer* to the Priests questions, and say that they cannot tel what they thought, did, or said, in yt great fear, and trouble of mind: (as oft times it chaunseth) then let the Priest Baptise him in form above written, concerning public Baptism, saving that at the dipping of the child in the Font, he shall use this form af words.

If thou be not Baptised al ready, N. I baptise the in the name of the father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

THE ORDER FOR THE

BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

¶	The priest meting the corpse at the Church style, shall say, Or else the priests and clerks shall sing, and so go either unto* the church, or towards the grave.



* "into" in 1604.



	I AM the resurrection and the life (saith the Lord) he that beleveth in me: yea, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever lives, and believes in me, shall not dye for ever.





Jhon xi.

I KNOW that my redemer lyveth, and that I shall rise out of the earth in the last day, and shall be covered again with my skin, and shall se God in my flesh: yea, and I my self shall behold him, not with other, but with the same eyes.





Job xix.

	WE brought nothing into this world, neither may we cary any thing out of this world.



i. Tim. vi.

	 The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. Even as it hath pleased the Lord so comes things to pass: Blessed be the name of the Lord.

¶	When they come to the grave, while the corps is made ready to be laid into the earth, ye priest shall say, or the priests, and clerks shall sing.



Job i.

	MAN that is borne of a woman has but a short time to lyve, and is full of misery: he comes up, and is cut down like a flower, he flies as it were a shadow, and never continues in one staye. In the midst of life we be in death, of whom my we seek for succour but of the, O Lord, which for our sins justly art displeased: yet O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy, and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. Thou know Lord the secretes of our hertes, shut not up thy merciful eyes to our prayers. But spare us Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from the.

¶ Then while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing by, the priest shall say.

FOR as much as it hath pleased almighty God of his great mercy to take unto him self the Soul of our dear brother, here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground, earth, to earth ashes, to ashes, dust, to dust, in sure, and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be like to his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue al things to him self.

Then shall be said, or songe.

I HEARD a voice from heaven saying unto me, write from hencefurth, blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord. Even so says the spirit that they rest from their labours.



Job xi.

Then shall follow this lesson, taken out of the . xv. Chap. to the Corin. the first Epistle.

CHRIST is risen from the dead, and become the first fruit of them that slept. For by a man came death, and by a man came the resurreccion of the dead. For as by Adam al die, even so by Christ shall al be made alive, but every manne in his own order. The first is Christ, then they that are Christ's at his coming. Then comes the end when he has delivered up the kyngedome to God the father, when he hath put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign till he have put his enemies under his fete. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he says, all things are put under him, it is manifest that hee is excepted, which did put all things under him. When al things are subdued unto him, then shall the son also him self be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be al in all, else what do they which are baptised over the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptised over them: yea, and why stand we always then in jeopardy? By our rejoicing which I have in Christ jesu our Lord, I dye daily. That I have fought with beasts Ephesus after the manner of men, what avauntageth it me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dye. Be not ye deceived; evil words corrupt good manners. Awake truly out of sleep, and sin not. For sum have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. But some manne will say how arise the dead? with what body shall they come? thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye. And what sowest thou? thou sowest not that body that shall be; but bare corn [=seed], as of wheat, or some other: but God gives it a body at his pleasure, to every sede his own body. All flesh is not one manner of flesh: but there is one manner of flesh of men, an other manner of flesh of beasts, an other of fishes, an other of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and there are bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one manner glory of the Son, and another glory of the Moan [Moon], and another glory of the stars. For one star differs from another in glory: so is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corrupcion, it rises again in incorrupcion. It is sown in dishonour, it rises again in honour. It is sown in weakness, it rises again in power. It is sown a natural body, it rises again a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body: as it is also written, the first man Adam was made a living soul, and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. How be it that is not first which is spiritual: but that which is natural and then that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy : The second manne is the Lord from Heaven (heavenly). As is the earthy, such are they that be earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly. This say I brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I show you a mystery. we shall not all sleep: but we shall al be changed, and that in a moment, in the twynkelynge of an eye by the last trump [trumpet]. For the trump shall blow, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. When this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortal hath put on immortality: then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory: Death, where is thy sting? Hell where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be unto God, which has given us victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore my dear brethren, be ye steadfast and unmovable, always rich in the work of the lord, forasmuch as ye know, howe that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

¶ The Lesson ended, the Priest shall say.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Our Father which art in heaven. &c.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Amen.



¶ The Priest.

ALMIGHTY God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence in the lord and in whom the souls of them that be elected, after they be delivered from the burden of the flesh, be in joy and felicity. We geve the hearty thanks for that it hath pleased the to deliver this N. our brother, out of the miseries of this synneful world beseeching the that it may please the of thy gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of thine elect, and to haste thy kyngedome, that we with this our brother, and all other departed in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our perfect consummacion and bliss, both in body and soul in thy eternal and everlasting glory. Amen.

¶ The Collect.

O MERCIFUL God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Resurrection and the life, in whom whosoever beleveth shall live, though he dye, and whosoever lives, and beleveth in him, shall not dye eternally, who also taught us (by his holy apostle Paule), not to be sorry as men without hope, for them that sleep in him: We mekely beseech the (O Father) to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, that when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our brother doth, and that at the general resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight, and receive that blessing which thy well-beloved son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear the, saiynge: Come ye blessed children of my father, receive the Kyngedome prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech the, O merciful father, through Jesus Christ our mediator and redemer. Amen.

¶ THE THANKESGEVINGE OF WOMEN

AFTER CHILD BIRTH,

COMMUNELYE CALLED

THE CHURCHYNGE OF WOMEN.



The woman shall come into the church, and there shall kneel down in some convenient place, nigh unto the place where the table stands, and the priest standing by her, shall say these words, or such like, as the case that require.

FORASMUCH as it hath pleased almighty God of his goodness to geve you safe deliverance, and hath preserved you in the great danger of childbirth: ye shall therefore geve hearty thanks unto God and pray.

¶ Then shall the priest say this Psalm.

I HAVE lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence comes my help.

My help comes even from the Lord: which hath made heaven and earth.

He will not suifre thy foot to be moved: and he that kepeth the, will not sleep.

Behold, he that kepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.

The Lord him self is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.

So that the son shall not burn the by day, neither the moon by night.

The Lord shall preserve the from al evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy soul.

The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for evermore.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son &c.

A COMMINATION AGAINST SINNERS,

WITH CERTAIN PRAYERS, TO BE USED DIVERS TIMES IN THE YEAR.



After Morning prayer, the people being called together by the ringing of a Bell, and assembled in the Church, thenglish Litany shall be said after thaccustomed manner, which ended the priest shall go into the pulpit and say thus.

BRETHREN, in the Primitive church there was a godly discipline, that at the beginning of Lent, such persons as were notoryus Sinners, were put to open penance and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the lord. And that others admonished by their example might be more afraid to offend. In the stead whereof (until the said Discipline may be restored again, which thing is much to be wished) it is thought good that at this time (in your presence) should be red the general sentences of gods cursing against impenitent Sinners, gathered out of the .xxvii. Chapiter of Deuteronomye, and other places of Scripture. And that ye should answer to every sentence. Amen. To the intent that you being admonished of the great indignation of God against Sinners: may the rather be called to earnest and true repentance, and may walk more warily in these dangerous days, fleeing from such vices, for the which ye affirm with your own mouths, the Curse of God to be due.

CURSED is the man that makes any carved, or molten Image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of the crafts man, and puts it in a secrete place to worship it.

Now saying that all they be accursed (as the Prophet David bears witness) [Psa. cxviii. =Ps. 119:21] which do err, and go astray from the cornmaundernentes of God, let us remembering the dreadful judgement hanging over our heads, and being always at hand return unto our Lord God, with all contricion and mekenes of heart, bewailing and lamenting our sinful life, knowledging [=acknowledging] and confessing our offences, and seeking to bring furs worthy fruits of penance. For now is the Axe put unto the root of the trees, so that every tree which brings not furs good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire. [Math. iii.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: [Heb. x.] he shall pour down rain upon the sinners, Snares, fire, and brimstone, storm and tempest, this shall be their portion to drink.[Psal. x. = Ps. 11:6] For lo, the Lord is common out of his place, to visit the wickedness of such as dwell upon the earth. [Esai. (Isaiah) xxvi.] But who may abide the day of his coming? Who shall be able to endure, when he apereth? [Mal. iii.] His fan is in his hand, and he will pourge his floor, and gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn the chafe with unquenchable fire. [Math. iii.] The day of the Lord comes as a thief upon the night, and when men shall say peace, and all things are sauf, then shall soubdenly destruction come upon them, as sorrow comes upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape. [i. Thes. v.] Then shall appear the wrath of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, through the stubburnnes of their heart, have heaped unto them self, [Rom. ii.] which despised the goodness, patience, and lunge sufferance of God, when he called them continually to repentance. Then shall they call upon me, says the Lord, but I will not hear: they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: and that because they hated knowledge, and received not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my counsel, and despised my correcyon, [Prover. i.] then shall it be to late to knock, when the door shall be shut, and to late to cry for mercy, when it is the tyrne of Justice. O terrible voice of most just judgement, which shall be 	pronounced upon them, when it shall be said unto them: Go, ye cursed, into the fire everlasting, which is prepared for the devil 	and his Aungeles. [Mat. xxv.] Therefore brethren take we heed by time, [betime, =in good time] while the day of salvation lasts, [ii. Cor. vi.] for the night comes when none can 	work: [Jhon ix.] but let us while we have the light, believe in the light, and walk as the children of the light, that we be not caste into the 	utter darckenes, where is wepyinge and gnasshynge of teeth. [Mat. xxv.] Let us not abuse the goodness of God, which calls us mercifully to amendment, and of his endelesse pytye promised us forgiveness of that which is paste [past]: If (with a whole mind and true heart) 	we return unto him. For though our sins be red as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow, and though they be like purple, 	yet shall they be as white as wolle. [Esay. (Isaiah) i.] Turn you clean (says the Lord) from all your wickedness, and your sin shall not be your destruction. [Ezechiel xxviii. =Ezek. 18] Cast away from you all your ungodliness that ye have done: make you new hearts, and a new spirit: wherefore will ye dye, O ye house of Israel? Seiyng that I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies (says the Lord God.) Turn you then, and you shall lyve. Although we have synned, yet have we an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he it 	is that obteyneth grace for our sins, [i. Jhon ii.] for he was wounded for our offences, and smitten for our wickedness. [Esai. liii.] Let us therefore return unto him, who is the merciful receiver of all true penitent sinners, assuring our self that he is ready to receive us, and most willing to pardon us, if we come to him, with faithful repentance. If we will submit our selves unto him, and from hencefurthe walk in his ways. If we will take his easy yoke, and light burden upon us, [Math. xi.] to follow him in lowliness, patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his holy spirit, seking always his glory, and serving him duly in our vocation with thanks gevynge. This if we do, Christ will deliver us from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction, which light upon them, that shall be set 	on the left hand, and he will set us on his right hand, and geve us the blessed benediction of his father, commanding us to take possession of his glorious kingdom, [Math. xxv.] unto the which he vouchesaufe to bring us al, for his infinite mercy.

¶	Then shall they all kneel upon their knees: And the Priests and Clerckes knelynge (were they are accustomed to say the Litany) shall say thy: Psalm. Miserere mei Deus.





The scripture references seen here within the text were placed in the margin in the original.

The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and a contrite heart O God, shalt thou not despise.

O be favourable and gracious unto Zion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of rightuousnesse, with the burnt offerings and oblations : then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine aultare.

Glory bee to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be world without end. Amen.

Let us pray.

O LORD, we beseech the, mercifully hear our prayers, and spare al those which confess their sins to the, that they (whose consciences by sin are accused) by thy merciful pardon may be absolved, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

O MOST mighty God, and merciful father which haste compassion of al men, and hate nothing that thou haste made: which would not the death of a sinner, but that he should rather turn from sin, and be saved: mercifully forgeve us our trespasses, and comfort us, which be grieved and wearied [wearied] with the burden of our sin. Thy property is to have mercy, to the only it appertains to forgeve sins: spare us therefore good Lord, spare thy people whom thou haste redeemed. Enter not into judgement with thy servauntes, which be vile earth, and miserable sinners, but so turn thine ire [ire] from us which mekely knowledge [=acknowledge] our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults: so make haste to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

THE ORDRE

FOR THE

ADMINISTRATION OF THE LORDS SUPPER,

OR

HOLY COMMUNION.



So many as entend to be partakers of the holy Communion, shall signify their names to the Curate over night; or else in the morning, before the beginning of morning prayer or immediately after.

And if any of those be an open and notorious evil liver, so that ye congregacion by him is offended, or have done any wrong to his neighbours by word or dede ye curate havyng knowledge thereof, shall cal him, and advertise him, in any wise not to presume to the Lords table, until he have openly declared him self to have truly repented, and amended his former naughty life, that the Congregacion may thereby be satisfied, which before were offended, and that he have recompensed the parties, who he hath done wrong unto, or at the least declare him self to be in full purpose so to doe, as sane as he conveniently may.

The same order shall the Curate use with those, betwixt whom he perceyveth malice and hatred to reign not suffering them to be partakers of the Lords table until he know them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties so at variance, he content to forgeve from the bottom of his hart, all that the other hath trespassed against him, and to make amends for that he hymn self hath offended: and the other party will not be persuaded to a godly unity, but remain still in his frowardness and malice The Minister in that case, ought to admit the penitent person to the holy Communion, and not him that is obstinate

The table, havyng at the Communion time a fair white linen cloth upon it, shall stand in the body of the church or in the chancel where morning prayer and evening prayour be appointed to be said. And the priest, standing at the North side of the table, shall say the Lords prayour with this collect following.

ALMIGHTY God, unto whom al hearts be open, al desires know, and from whom no secretes are hyd: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiracion of thy holy spirit, that we may perfectly love the, and worthily magnify thy holy name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest rehearse distinctly at the .x. Commandments, and the people knelyng, shall after every Commandment ask Gods mercy for their transgression of the same, after this sort.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law.

Wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day and halowed it.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our. &c.

Minister. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God gives the.

People. Lord have mercy upon us, and write al these thy laws in our hearts we beseech the.

¶ Then shall follow the Collect of the day with one of these two Collects following for the Queen, the Priest standing up and saying.

ALMIGHTY God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and power infinite, have mercy upon the whole congregacion, and so rule the heart of thy chose servant Elizabeth our Queen and governor that she (knowing whose minister she is) may above all things, seek thy honour and glory: and that we her subjects, (duly considering whose authority she hath) may faithfully serve, honour, and humbly obey her in the and for the, according to thy blessed word, and ordinance, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with the and the holy ghost, lyveth and reygneth ever one God, world without end. Amen.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, we be taught by thy holy word, that the hearts of Princes are in thy rule and governauce, and that thou doest dispose, and turn them as it seems best to thy Godly wisdom: we humbly beseech thee, so to dispose and govern the heart of Elizabeth, thy servant, our Queen and governor, that in all her thoughts, words, and works she may ever seek thy honour and glory, and study to preserve thy people committed to her charge, in wealth, peace and godliness. Grant this O merciful father, for thy dear sons sake Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Immediately after the Collects, the Priest shall read the Epistle beginning thus.

The Gospel written in the. Chapiter of.

And the Epistle and Gospel being ended, shall be said the Cred.

I BELIEVE in one God, the father almighty maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesu Christ, the only begotten son of GOD, begotten of his father before al worlds, god of God, light of light, very God of very God, gotten, not made, being of one substance with the father, by whom all things were made, who for us men, and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the holy Ghost, of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us, under poncius Pilot. He suffered and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the father. And he shall come again with glory, to judge both the quick and the dead, whose Kingdom shall have none end. And I believe in the holy Ghost, The Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the father and the son, who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified who spake by the Prophets. And I believe one catholic and Apostolicke Church. I acknowledge one Baptism, for the remission of sins. And I loke for the resurreccion of the dead : and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Let us pray for the whole estate of Christ's Church militant here in earth.



Psal. lxi.

ALMIGHTY and everliving God, which by thy holy Apostle hast taught us to make prayers and supplicacyons, and to geve thanks for all men: We humbly beseech thee most mercifully (to accept our almose) and to receive these our prayers which of we offer unto thy divine majesty, beseeching the to inspire continually, the universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity, and concorde: And grant that all they that do confess thy holy name, may agree in the truth of thy holy word, and lyve in unity and godly love. We beseech thee also to save and defend alle Christian Kings, Princes, and Governors, and specially thy servant, Elizabeth our Queen that under her we may be godly and quietly governed: and grant unto her whole Counsel, and to all that be put in authority under her, that they may truly and indifferently [impartially] minister justice, to the punishment of wickedness and vice, and to the maintenance of gods true religion and virtue. Give grace (O heavenly Father) to al Bishops, Pastors and Curates, that they may both by their life and doctrine set furs thy true and lively word and rightly and duly administer thy holy Sacraments: and to all thy people give thy heavenly grace, and especially to this congregacion hear present, that with meke heart and due reverence, they may hear and receive thy holy word, truly serving the in holiness and ryghtuousnes all the days of their life. And we most humbly beseech the of thy goodness (O Lord) to comfort and succour all them which in this transitory life bee in trouble, Sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity. Grant this, O father, for Jesus Christ's sake our only Mediator and advocate. Amen.





If there be none alms given unto the poor, then shall the words of accepting our alms bee left out unsaid.



Then shall follow this exhortacion, at certain times when the Curate shall see the people negligent to come to the holy Communion.



WE be come together at this time, dearly beloved brethren to fed at the Lords supper, unto the which in Gods behalf I bid you all that be hear present, and beseech you for the lord Jesus Christ's sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so lovingly called, and bidden of God him self. Ye know howe grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a manne hath prepared a rich feast: decked his table with al kind of provision, so that there lacks nothing but the gestes to sit down: and yet they which be called without any cause, most unthankfully refuse to come. Which of you in such a case would not be moved? Who would not think a great injury and wrong done unto him? Wherefore most dearly beloved in Christ take ye good head, lest ye, withdrawing your selves from this holy supper, and provoke Gods indignation against you, it is an easy matter for a man to say, I will not communicate, because I am otherwise let [hindered] with worldly busynes, but such excuses be not so easily accepted and allowed before god. If any man say, I am a grievous sinner, and therefore am afraid to come. Wherefore then do ye not repent and amend? When god calls you, be you not ashamed to say ye will not come? when you should return to god, will you excuse your self and say that you be not ready? Considre earnestly with your selves howe little such feigned excuses shall avail before God. They that refused the feast in the Gospel, because they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of oxen, or because they were married, were not so excused, but conpted [counted] unworthy of the heavenly feast. I for my part am here present and according to mine office, I bid you in the name of god, I cal you in Christ's behalf, I exhort you, as you love your own Salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the son of God, did vouchesafe to yield up his soul by death upon the cross for your health, even so it is your duty to receive the Communion together in the remembrance of his death as he himself cornmaunded. Now, if ye will in no wise thus do, consider with your selves, how great injury ye doe unto God, and howe sore punishment hangs over your heads for the same. And whereas ye offend God so sore in refusing this holy banquet, I admonish, exhort, and beseech you, that unto this unkindness ye will not add any more. Which thing ye shall doe if ye stand by as gazers and lokers of them that do Communicate, and be no partakers of the same your selves. For what thing can this be accounted else, then a further contempt and unkindness unto God? Truly it is a great unthankefulnes to say nay when ye be called, but the fault ismuche greater, when men stand by, and yet will neither eat, nor drink this holy Communion with other. I pray you what can this be ells but even to have the mysteries of Christ in derision: it is said unto al: Take ye and eat, take and drink ye al of this, do this in remembrance of me. With what face then, or with what countenance shall ye here these words? what will this be else, but a neglecting, a despising, and mocking of the Testament of Christ? wherefore rather the you should so do, depart you hence, and geve place to them that be Godly disposed. But when you depart, I beseech you pondre with yourselves, from whom ye depart: ye depart from the Lords Table: ye depart from your brethren, and from the banquet [banquet] of most heavenly food. These things (if ye earnestly consydre) ye shall by Gods grace, return to a better mind, for the obtaining whereof, we shall make our humble petitions while we shall receive the holy Communion.

And some time shall be said this also, at the discretion of the Curate.

DEARLY beloved, for as much as our duty is to rendre to almighty God our heavenly father most hearty thanks for that he has given his son our Saviour Jesus Christ not only to die for us, but also to be our Spiritual foot, and sustenance, as it is declared unto us, as well by Gods word, as by the holy sacraments of his blessed body and blood, the which being so comfortable a thing to them which receive it worthily and so dangerous to them, that will presume to receive it, unworthily. My duty is to exhort you to considre the dignity of the holy mystery, and the great peril of the unworthy receiving thereof, and so to search and examine your own conscieces, as you should come holy and clean to a most godly and heavenly feast, so that in no wise you come but in the marriage garment, required of God in holy scripture, and so come and be received as worthy partakers of such a heavenly Table, the way and means thereto is.

First to examine your lives and conversation by the rule of Gods commandments and wherinsoeuer ye shall perceive your selves to have offended either by will, word, or deed, there bewail your own sinful lives, confess your selves to almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offences to be such, as be not only against God, but also against your neighbours. Then ye shall reconcile your selves unto them, ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the uttermost of your powers for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other, and likewise being ready to forgeve other that have offended you as you would have forgiveness of your offences at Gods hand. For otherwise the receiving of the holy Communion doth nothing else, but increase your dampnation.

And because it is requisite that no manne should come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in gods mercy, and with a quiet conscience: therefore if there be any of you, which by the means aforesaid cannot quiet his own conscience, but requires further comfort or counsel, then let him come to me, or some other discrete and learned minister of gods word, and open his grief, that he may receive such ghostly counsel, advise, and comfort, as his conscience may be relived, and that by the ministry of Gods word, he may receive comfort, and the benefyte of absolution, to the quieting of his conscience, and advoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.

¶ Then shall the Priest say this exhortation.

DEARLY beloved in the Lord: Ye that mind to come to the holy Communion of the body and blood of our savioure Christ, must consider what saint Paule writes unto the Corinthiens, howe he exhorts all persons diligently to try and examine them selves, before they presume to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For as the benefyte is great, if with a truly penitent heart and lively faith we receive that holy sacrament (for then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blonde, then we dwell in Christ and Christ in us, we be one with Christ, and Christ with us) so is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily. For then we be guilty of the body and blood of Christ our saviour. We eat and drink our own dampnation, not considering the lords body. we kindle Gods wrath against us, we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry kinds of death. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of god, an hinderer or slanderer of his word, an adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, bewail your Sins, and come not to this holy table, lest after the taking of that holy sacrament, the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of al iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. Judge therefore your selves (brethren) that ye be not judged of the Lord. Repent you truly for your sins past, have a lively and steadfast faith in Christ our saviour. Amend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men, so shall ye be mete partakers of those holy mysteries. And above al things ye must geve most humble and hearty thanks to God the father, the soon, and the holy ghost, for the redemption of the world by the death and passion of our saviour Christ, both God and man, who did humble him self, even to the death, upon the cross, for us miserable sinners which lay in darckenes, and shadow of death, that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end that we should always remember the exceeding great love of our master and only saviour Jesu Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits (which by his precious bloudsheading) he hath obtained to us, he hath instituted and ordained holy mysteries, as pledges of his love, and continual remembrance of his death, to our great and endless comfort. To him therefore with the father and the holy Ghost, let us geve (as we are most bounden) continual thanks, submitting our selves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and studiyng to serve him in true holiness and righteousness, al the days of our life. Amen.





Then shall the Priest say to them that come to receive the holy Communion.

You that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and be in love, and charity with your neighbours and entende to led a new life, following the commandments of God, and walking from hence furthe in his holy ways: Draw ne'er and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort make your humble confession to almighty God, before this congregation here gathered together in his holy name, mekely knelynge upon your knees.

¶	Then shall this general confession be made, in the name of all those, that are minded to receive this holy Communion, either by one of them, or else by one of the ministers, or by the priest him self, all kneling humbly upon their knees.

ALMIGHTY God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ, maker of all things, Judge of all men, we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have committed, by thought word and deed, against thy divine Majesty, provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us: we do earnestly repent, and bee heartily sorry for these our misdoings, the remembrance of them is grievous unto us: the burden of them is intolerable: have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful father, for thy son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, forgeve us all that is paste, and grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please the, in newenes of life, to the honour and glory of thy name through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ Then shall the priest or the Bishop (being present) stand up, and turning himself to the people shall say thus.

ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly father, who of his great mercy has promised forgiveness of sins, to al them, which with hearty repentance and true faith turn to him: have mercy upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your sins, confirm and strengthen you in all goodness, and bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Then shall the Priest also say.

Here what comfortable words our saviour Christ saith to all them that truly turn to him.

¶ COME unto me all that travail and be heavy laden, and I shall refresh you. So God loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, to the end that al that believe in him, should not perish but have life everlasting.

Hear also what S. Paule saith.

¶ This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.

Hear also what S. John says.

¶ If any manne sin, we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propiciation for our sins.

¶ After the which the priest shall proceed saying.

Lift up your hearts.

Answer. We lift them up unto the Lord.

Priest. Let us geve thanks unto our Lord God.

Answer. It is mete and right so to do.

¶ Priest. It is very mete, right, and our bounden duty that we should at al times, and in all places, geve thanks to the, O Lord holy father, almighty everlasting God.

Here shall follow the proper prefaces, according to the time, if there be any specially appointed, or else immediately shall follow:

Therefore with angles &c.





¶ PROPER PREFACES.

Upon Christmas day and seven days after.

BECAUSE thou did geve Jesus Christ, thine only Son, to be borne as this day for us, who by the operation of the holy ghost was made very man of the substance of the virgin Mary his mother, and that without spot of sin, to make us clean from al sin. Therefore with angels &c.

Upon Easter day, and vii days after.

BUT chiefly are we bound to praise the for the glorious resurrection of thy son Jesus Christ our lord, for he is the very paschal lamb, which was offred for us, and hath taken away the sin of the world, who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his rising to life again, hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore with angels

Upon the Ascension day, and vii days after.

THROUGH thy most dear beloved son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who after his most glorious resurrection, manifestly appeared to al his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into heaven, to prepare a place for us, that where he is, thither might we also ascend, and reign with him in glory. Therefore with angels &c.

Upon Wytsonday, and vi days after.

THROUGH Jesu Christ our Lord, according to whose most true promise, the holy ghost came down this day from heaven, with a sodden great sound, as it had been a mighty wind, in the likeness of fiery tongues lighting upon the Apostles, to teach them, and to lead them to all truth, giving them both the gift of divers languages, and also boldness with fervent zeal, constantly to preach the gospel unto all nations, whereby we are brought out of darcknes and error into the clear light and true knowledge of the, and of thy son Jesus Christ. Therefore with Angels &c.

Upon the feast of Trinity only.

IT is very mete right, and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and in all places, geve thanks to the, O Lord, almighty and everlasting God, which art one god, one lord, not one only person, but three persons in one substance, for that which we believe of the glory of the father, the same we believe of the son, and of the holy ghost, without any difference or inequality. Therefore &c.

¶ After which preface, shall follow immediately.

THEREFORE with Angles and Archangels, and with all the company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious name, evermore praising thee, and saying: Holy, holy, holy, lord god of hostess, heven and earth are full of thy glory, glory be to the, O Lord most high.

¶ Then shall the priest knelynge down at Gods board, say in the name of all them that shall receive the communion, this prayer following.

WE do not presume to come to this thy table (O merciful Lord) trusting in our own rightuousnesse, but in thy manifold and great mercies, we be not worthy so much as to gather up the crommes under thy Table, but thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy. Grant us therefore gracious Lord, so to eat the fieshe of thy dear son Jesus Christ, and to drink his blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and our souls washed through his most precious blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us.





Then the priest standing up, shall say as follows:

	ALMIGHTY God our heavenly father which of thy tender rnercye, did give thine only Son Jesus Christ, to suffer death upon the Cross for our redeption, who made there (by his one oblation of himself once offered) a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, and did institute, and in his holy gospel command us to continue a perpetual memory of that his precious death, until his coming again: Hear us O merciful father, we beseech the, and grant that we receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine, according to thy son our saviour Jesu Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood, who in the same night that he was betrayed, toke bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take, eat, this is my body, which is given for you. Doe this in remembrance of me. Likewise after supper he toke the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for you and for many, for remission of sins: doe this as oft as ye shall drink it in remembrance of me.

¶	Then shall the minister first receive the Communion in both kinds him self, and next deliver it to other Ministers (if any be there present, that they may help the chief minister) and after to the people in their hands kneling. And when he delivers the bread, he shall say.

THE body of our lord Jesu Christ, which was given for the, preserve thy body and soul into everlasting life: and take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, feed on him in thine heart by faith, with thankesgevynge.

And the minister that delivers the cup shall say.

THE blood of our lord Jesu Christ, which was shed for the, preserve thy body and soul into everlasting life: and drink this in remembrance that Christ's blood was shed for thee, and be thankeful.

Then shall the priest say the Lords prayer, the people repetynge after him every petition.

¶ After shall be said as follows.

O LORD and heavenly father, we thy humble servaunts, entirely desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our Sacrifice of praise and thankesgeving most humbly beseeching thee to grant, that by the merits and death of thy son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood, we (and all thy whole church,) may obtain remission of our sins, and al other benefits of his passion. And here we offer and present unto the, O Lord, our selves, our souls, and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto the, humbly beseeching the, that al we which be partakers of this holy communion, may be fulfilled with thy grace, and heavenly benediction. And although we be unworthy through our manifold sins, to offer unto the any sacrifice, yet we beseech the to accept this our bounden duty and service, not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences, through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom and with whom, in the unity of the holy ghost, all honour and glory be unto the, O father almighty, world without end. Amen.

Or this,

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, we most heartily thank the, for that thou doest vouchsafe to fed us, which have duly received these holy mysteries, with the spiritual foot of the most precious body and blood of thy son, our saviour Jesus Christ, and doest assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness toward us, and that we be very members incorporate in thy mistical body, which is the blessed company of al faithful people, and be also heirs through hope of thy everlasting kingdom, by the merits of the most precious death and passion of thy dear soon. We now most humbly beseech the, O heavenly father, so to assist us with thy grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in, through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom with the and the holy ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.

Then shall be said or songe.

GLORY be to God on high. And in earth peace, good will towards men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee, wee geve thanks to thee, for thy great glory. O Lord God, heavenly King, God the father Almighty. O Lord the only begotten Son Jesu Christ. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the father, that take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us: Thou that take away the Sins of the world, have mercy upon us. Thou that take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. Thou that sit at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon us. For thou only art holy: Thou only art the Lord, thou only O Christ with the holy Ghost, art most high in the Glory of God the father. Amen.

Then the Priest or the Bishop, if he be present, shall let them depart with this blessing.

THE peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts, and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesu Christ, our Lord. And the blessing of God almighty, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, be among you, and remain with you always. Amen.





¶	Collects to be said after thofertory when there is no Communion; every such day one. And the same may be said also as often as occasion shall serve, after the Collects, either of Morning and Evening Prayer, Communion, or Litany, by the discretion of the minister.

ASSIST us mercifully, O Lord, in these our Supplications and Prayers, and dispose the way of thy servauntes toward the attainement of everlasting salvation, that among al the changes, and chances of this mortal life, they may ever be defended by thy most gracious, and ready help. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

O ALMIGHTY Lord and everlivyng God, vouchesafe we beseech the, to direct, sanctify, and govern both our hearts, and bodies, in the ways of thy laws, and in the worckes of thy commandments, that through thy most mighty protection, both here and ever, we may bee preserved in body and Soul: through our lord and Savioure Jesus Christ. Amen.

GRANT we beseech the almighty God, that the words which we have herd this day with our outward ears, may through thy grace be so graffed [grafted] inwardly in our hearts, that they may bring furs in us the fruit of good living, to the honour and praise of thy name: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

PREVENT [Direct] us O Lord in all our doings, with thy most gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help, that in al our works begone, continued, and ended in the: we may glorify thy holy name, and finally by thy mercy, obtain everlasting life, Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

ALMIGHTY God, the fountain of all wisdom, which know our necessities before we ask, and our ignorance in asking, we beseech the to have compassion upon our infirmities, and those things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindenes we cannot ask, vouchesafe to geve us for the worthiness of thy son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

ALMIGHTY God, which haste promised to here the petitions of them that ask in thy sons name, we beseech the mercifully to incline thine Ears to us that have made now now our prayers and supplications unto the, and grant that those things which we have faithfully asked, according to thy will, may effectually be obtained to the relief of our necessity, and to the setting furs of thy glory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ CONFIRMATION,


WHEREIN IS CONTAINED A CATECHISM FOR CHILDREN.



1559 Title

The Order of Confirmation, or laying

on of hands upon children baptised, and able

to render an account of their Faith, according

to the Catechism following.





1604 Title

TO the end that confirmation may be ministered to the more edifying of such, as shall receive it (according unto S. Paules doctrine, who teaches that al things should he done in ye Church, to the edification of the same) it is thought good that none hereafter shall be confirmed but such as can say in their mother tongue the articles of the faith, the Lords prayer, and the x Commandments: And can also answer to such questions of this short Catechism, as the Bishop (or such as he shall appoinct) shall by his discretion oppose [=examine] them in. And this order is most convenient to be observed for divers consideracions.

First, because that when children come to the years of discretion, and have learned what their godfathers and godmothers promised for them in Baptism, they may then themselves with their own mouth, and with their awne consent, openly before the Church, ratify and confirm the same, and also promise that by the grace of God, they shall evermore endeavour themselves faithfully to observe and keep such things, as they by their own mouth and confession have assented unto.

Secondly, forasmuch as Confirmation is ministered to them that be Baptised, that by imposition of hands and prayer, they may receive strength and defence against all temptacions to sin, and the assaults of the world and the Devil: it is most mete to be ministered when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their awne flesh, partly by the assaults of the world and the Devil, they begin to be in danger to fall into sundry kinds of sin.

Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the usage of the Church, in times paste, whereby it was ordained that Confirmation should he ministered to them that were of perfect [=proper, appropriate] age, that they, being instructed in Christ's religion, should openly profess their awne faith, and promise to be obedient unto the will of God.

And that no man shall think that any detriment shall come to children by deferring [deferring] of their Confirmation; he shall know for truth, that it is certain by Gods word, that children being baptised, have all things necessary for their salvation, and be undoubtedly saved.





A CATECHISM,

THAT IS TO SAY,

AN INSTRUCTION TO BE LEARNED OF EVERY CHILD BEFORE HE BE BROUGHT TO BE CONFIRMED OF THE BISHOP.



Question. WHAT is your name?

* "works, the pomps and" in 1604.





Question. Doest thou not think that thou art bound to believe and to do, as they have promised for the?

Answer. Yes verily, and by Gods help so I will. And I heartily thank our heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this state of salvation, through Jesus Christ our saviour. And I pray God to geve me his grace, that I may continue in the same unto my lives end.

Question. Rehearse the Articles of thy belefe.

Answer. I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and of earth. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord. Which was conceived of the holy Ghost. Borne of the Virgin Mary. Suffered under Ponce Pilot, was crucified, dead and buried, he descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy ghost. The holy catholic Church. The Communion of saints. The forgiveness of sins. The resurrection of the body. And the life everlasting. Amen.

Question. What doest thou chiefly learn in these articles of thy belief?

Answer. First, I learn to believe in God the father, who hath made me and al the world.

Secondly, in God the son, who hath redeemed me and all mankind.

Thirdly, in God the holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the elect people of God.

Question. You said, that your godfathers and godmothers, did promise for you, that you should keep Gods commandments. Tell me how many there be?

Answer. Ten.

Question. Which be they?

Answer. The same which God spake in the .xx. cha of Exodus, saying: I am the Lord thy God which have brought the out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have none other gods but me.

II. Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneth, nor in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down to them nor worship them. For I the Lord thy God, am a gelous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto the iii and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

III. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

IIII. Remember thou keep holy the Sabboth day. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all that thou hast to do: but the vii day is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt do no manner of worcke, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maidservant, thy cattle, and the stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and al that in them is, and rested the vii day, wherefore the Lord blessed the vii day, and halowed it.

V. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God gives the.

VI. Thou shalt do no murder.

VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

VIII. Thou shalt not steal.

IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.

Question. What doest thou chiefly learn by these commandments?

Answer. I learn two things. My duty towards God, and my duty towards my neighbour.

Question. What is my duty towards God?

Answer. My duty towards God is, to believe in him, to fear him [=to hold him in awe], and to love him with all my heart, with al my mind, with al my soul, and with all my strength. To worship him. To geve him thanks. To put my whole trust in hyrn. To call upon him. To honour his holy name and his word, and to serve him truly all the days of my life.

Question. What is thy duty toward thy neighbour?

Answer. My duty towards my neighbor is to love him as my self: And to do to all men as I would they should do unto me. To love, honour, and succour my father and mother. To honour and obey the King, and his ministers. To submit my self to al my governors, teachers, spiritual Pastors and Masters. To order my self lowly and reverently to all my betters. To hurt no body by word, nor dede. To be true and just in all my dealing. To bear no malice nor hatred in my heart. To keep my hands from pickyng and stealing, and my tongue from evil speaking, lying and slandering. To keep my body in temperance, soberness, and chastity. Not to covet nor desire other men goods. But learn and labour truly to get mine awne living, and to do my duty in that state of life, unto which it shall please God to cal me.

Question. My good child know this, that thou art not able to do these things of thy self, nor to walk in the commandments of God, and to serve him, without his special grace, which thou must learn at al times to cal for by diligent prayer. Let me hear therefore, if thou can say the Lords prayer.

Answer. Our Father which art in heaven; Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Geve us this day our daily bread. And forgeve us our trespasses, as we forgeve them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Question. What desire thou of God in this prayer?

Answer. I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the giver of al goodness, to send his grace unto me, and to all people, that we may worship him, serve him, and obeye him as we ought to doe. And I pray unto God, that he will send us all things that be needful, both for our souls and bodies. And that he will be merciful unto us, and forgeve us our sins: and that it will please him to save and defend us in al dangers ghostly [=spiritually] and bodily : and that he will keep us from all sin and wikednes, and from our ghostly enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I trust he will do of his mercy and goodness, through our lord Jesu Christ. And therefore I say. Amen. So be it.

Question. HOW many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in his Church?

Answer. Two only as generally necessary to salvation; that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.

Answer. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin; and faith, whereby they steadfastly believe the promises of God, made to them in that Sacrament.

Question. What is required of those which come to the Lords Supper?

And with the Collects: First of the day, the second of peace, the third for aid against all perils, as hereafter follows, which two last Collects shabe daily said at Evening Prayer without alteration.

The second Collect at Evening Prayer.

O	GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed: geve unto thy servauntes that peace, which the world cannot geve: that both our hertes may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness.

In	the feasts of christmas, the Epiphany, S. Mothy, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, S. John Baptist, S. James, S. Bartholomew, S. Matthew, S. Simon, and Jude, S. Andrew, and Trinity Sunday: Shall be songe or said immediately after Benedictus, this confession of our Christen faith.

WHOSOEVER will be saved : before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith.

Which Faith, except every one do keep holy, and undefiled : without doubt he shall perysh everlastingly.

And the Catholic Faith is this : that we worship one God in Trinity, and trinity in unity.

Neither confounding the persons : nor dividing the substance.

For there is one person of the Father, an other of the Son : and another of the holy ghost.

But the Godhed of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, is al one : the glory equal, the majesty coeternall.

Such as the Father is, such is the son : and such is the holy ghost.

The father uncreate, the son uncreate : and the holy ghost uncreate.

The Father incomprehensible, the son incomprehensible : and the holy Ghost incomprehensible.

The father eternal, the son eternal : and the holy Ghost eternal.

And yet they are not three eternalles : but one eternal.

As also there be not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated : but One uncreated, and one incomprehensible.

So likewise the Father is almighty, the son almighty : and the holy ghost almighty.

And yet are not there three Almighties, but one almighty.

So the father is God, the son is God : and the holy Ghost is God.

And yet are they not three Gods : but one God.

So likewise the father is Lord, the son Lord : and the holy ghost Lord.

And yet not three Lords : but one Lord.

For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity : to acknowledge every person by him self to be God, and Lord.

So are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion : to say there be three Gods, or three Lords.

The father is made of none : neither created, nor begotten.

The son is of the Father alone : not made, nor created, but begotten.

The holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son : neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

So there is one father, not three fathers, one son, not three sons : one holy Ghost, not three holy Ghosts.

And in this trinity, none is before, or after other : none is greater, nor less than other.

But the whole three persons : be coeternall toguether and coequal.

So that in all things as is aforesaid : the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in unity is to be worshipped.

He therefore that will be saved : must thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation : that he also believe rightly in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesu Christ.

For the right Faith is, that we believe and Confess : that our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God, is God and Man;

God of the Substance of the father, begotten before the worlds : and man of the substance of his mother, borne in the world.

Perfect god, and perfect man of a reasonable Soul, and human flesh subsisting.

Equal to the father as touching his godhood : and inferior to the father, touching his manhood.

Who although he be God and man : yet he is not two, but one Christ.

One; not by conversion of the Godhood into flesh: but by taking of the manhood into God;

One altogether, not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of person.

For as the reasonable soul and flesh is but one man : so God and man is but one Christ.

Who suffered for our salvation : descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead.

He ascended into heaven: he sits bn the right hand of the father, God Almighty, from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies and shall geve account for their own worckes.

And they that have done good, shall go into life everlasting and they that have done evel, into everlasting fire.

This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he can not be saved.

Glory be to the father, and to the son: and to the holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.

Thus ends the order of Morning and Evening Prayer through the whole year.

GODLY PRAYERS.

¶ CERTAIN GODLY PRAYERS TO BE USED FOR SUNDRY PURPOSES.



A general confession of sins, to be said every morning.

O ALMIGHTY God, our heavenly Father, I confess and knowledge, that I am a miserable and a wretched sinner, and have manifold ways most grievously transgressed thy most godly commandments, through wicked thoughts, ungodly lusts, sinful words and deeds, and in my whole life. In sin am I borne and conceived, and there is no goodness in me; inasmuch as if thou shouldest enter into thy narrow judgement with me, judging me according unto the same, I were never able to suffer or abide it, but must needs perish and be dampned [damned] for ever: So little help, comfort, or succour is there either in me, or in any other creature. Only this is my comfort (O heavenly Father), that thou did not spare thy only dear beloved son, but did give him up unto the most bitter, and most vile and slanderous death of the Cross for me, that hee might so pay the ransom for my sins, satisfy thy judgement, still and pacify thy wrath, reconcile me again unto thee, and purchase me thy grace and thy favour, and everlasting life. Wherefore, through the merit of his most bitter death and passion, and through his innocent bloodshedding, I beseech the, O heavenly Father, that thou wilt vouchsafe to bee gracious and merciful unto me, to forgive and pardon me al my sins, to lighten my heart with thy holy Spirit, to renew, confirm, and strengthen me with a right and a perfect faith, and to inflame me in love toward thee and my neighbour, that I may hencefurth with a willing and a glad heart, walk as becomes me, in thy most godly commandments, and so glorify and praise the everlastingly. And also that I may with a free conscience and quiet heart, in all manner of temptations, afflictions, or necessities, and even in the very pangs of death, cry boldly and merrily unto thee, and say : I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, &c. But, O Lord God heavenly father, to comfort myself in affliction and temptation with these articles of the Christian faith, it is not in my power, for faith is thy gift: and forasmuch as thou wilt bee prayed unto, and called upon for it, I come unto thee, to pray and beseech the, both for that and for all my other necessities, even as thy decree beloved Son our Saviour Iesus Christ himself hath taught us. And from the very bottom of my heart I cry, and say: Our Father, which art in heaven. &c.





These prayers were never officially part of the Book of Common Prayer, but were often bound up with it. The prayers given here come from three sources. The first is from a 1567 BCP, as found in an 1847 reprint, Liturgical Services in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. The second and third are from actual Books of Common Prayer published in 1599 and 1634. The presence of each prayer in each BCP is indicated at the right.

These prayers are also found bound up with the 1552 BCP, in substantially the same form as in the 1567 Book





1567, 1599, 1634





¶ Prayers to be said in the Morning.

O MERCIFUL Lord God, heavenly Father, I render most high laudes, praise, and thanks unto thee, that thou hast preserved me both this night, and all the time and days of my life hitherto, under thy protection, and hast suffered me to live until this present hour. And I beseech thee heartily, that thou wilt vouchsafe to receive me this day, and the residue of my whole life, from hencefurth into thy tuition [=protection], ruling and governing me with thy holy Spirit, that all manner of darkness, of misbeleefe, infidelity, and of carnal lusts and affections, may be utterly chased and driven out of my heart, and that I may be justified and saved both body and soul through a right and a perfect faith, and so walk in the light of thy most godly truth, to thy glory and praise, and to the profit and furtherance of my neighbour, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Amen.



1567, 1599, 1634

ALL possible thanks that wee are able, wee render unto thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, for that thou hast willed this night past to bee prosperous unto us; and we beseech thee likewise to prosper all this same day unto us for thy glory, and for the health of our soul: and that thou which art the true light, not knowing any going down, and which art the Sun eternal, giving life, food, and gladness unto all things, vouchsafe to shine into our minds, that we may not any where stumble to fall into any sin, but may thorough [through] thy good guiding and conducting, come to the life everlasting. Amen.

1567, 1599

O LORD Jesus Christ, which art the true Sun of the world, evermore arising, and never going down, which by thy most wholesome appearing and sight, doest bring forth, preserve, nourish, and refresh all things, as well that are in heaven, as also that are on earth : we beseech thee mercifully and favourably to shine into our hearts, that the night and darkness of sins, and the mists of errors on every side driven away, thou brightly shining within our harts, we may all our life space go without any stumbling or offence, and may decently and seemly walk, (as in the day time,) being pure and clean from the works of darkness, and abounding in all good works which God hath prepared for us to walk in: which with the Father and with the holy Ghost livest and reign for ever and ever. Amen.

1567, 1599, 1634;

also found in the 1545 Primer

O GOD and Lord Iesus Christ, thou know, yea, and hast also taught us, how great the infirmity and weakness of man is, and how certain a thing it is that it can nothing doe without thy godly help. If man trust to himself, it cannot bee avoided, but that hee must headlong run and fall into a thousand undoings and mischiefs. O our Father, have thou pity and compassion upon the weakness of us thy children, bee thou pressed [=willing] and ready to help us, always showing thy mercy upon us, and prospering whatsoever we godly go about: so that, thou giving us light, wee may see what things are truly good in deed; thou encouraging us, wee may have an earnest desire to the same; and thou being our guide, wee may come where to obtain them : for wee having nothing but mistrust in our selves, doe yield and commit our selves full and whole unto thee alone, which workest all things in al creatures, to thy honour and glory. So be it.



1567, 1599

A prayer against temptation.

O LORD Jesus Christ, the only stay and fence of our mortal state, our only hope, our only salvation, our glory, and our triumph, who in the flesh (which thou had for our only cause taken upon thee) did suffer thy self to be tempted of Satan, and who only and alone of all men did utterly overcome and vanquish sin, death, the world, the devil, and all the kingdom of hell : and whatsoever thou hast so overcommed, for our behoof [behalf] it is that thou hast overcommed it : neither hath it been thy will to have any of thy servants to keep battle or fight with any of the foresaid evils, but of purpose to reward us with a crown of the more glory for it. And to the intent that thou might likewise overthrow Satan in thy members, as thou had before done in thine own person, give thou (wee beseech thee) unto us thy soldiers (O Lion most victorious of the tribe of Juda) strength against the roaring Lion, which continually wanders to and fro, seeking whom he may devour. Thou being that same Serpent, the true giver of health and life, that were nailed on high upon a tree, give unto us, thy little seely ones, wiliness against the deceitful awaiting of the most subtle serpent. Thou being a Lamb as white as snow, the vanquisher of Satins tyranny, give unto us thy little sheep the strength and virtue of thy spirit, that being in our own selves weak and feeble, and in thee strong and valiant, wee may withstand and overcome all assaults of the devil, so that our ghostly enemy may not glory on us, but being conquered through thee, we may give thanks to thy mercy, which never leaves them destitute that put their trust in thee : who livest and reign God for ever without end. Amen.



1567, 1599

A prayer for the obtaining of wisdom.

O GOD of our fathers, and Lord of mercy, thou that hast made all things with thy word, and ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made, that he should order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgement with a true heart : give me wisdom, which is ever about thy state, and put me not out from among thy children : for I thy servant and son of thy handmaid am a feeble person, of a short time, and too young to the understanding of thy judgements and laws : yea, though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing worth. O send thy wisdom out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy majesty, that she may be with me and labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable in thy sight; for she knows and understands all things, and she shall conduct me right soberly in thy works, and preserve me in her power: so shall my works be acceptable. Amen.

A prayer against worldly carefulness.

O MOST dear and tender father, our defender and nourisher, endue us with thy grace, that we may cast off the great blindness of our minds, and carefulness of worldly things, and may put our whole study and care in keeping of thy holy law ; and that wee may labour and travail for our necessities in this life, like the birds of the ayre, and the lilies of the field, without care. For thou hast promised to be careful for us, and hast commanded that upon thee we should cast al our care : which livest and reign, world without end. Amen.

A prayer necessary for all persons.

O MERCIFUL God, I wretched sinner reknowledge [acknowledge] myself bound to keep thy holy commandments, but yet unable to perform them, and to bee accepted for just without the righteousness of Jesus Christ thy only Son, who hath perfectly fulfilled thy law, to justify all men that believe and trust in him.

Order my life so, O Lord, that it be always acceptable unto thee. Give me grace not to rejoice in any thing that displeases thee, but evermore to delight in those things that please thee, be they never so contrary to my desires. Teach me so to pray, that my petitions may be graciously heard of the.

O Lord, grant me thus to doe, for the glory of thy holy name. Amen.

A prayer necessary to be said at all times.

O BOUNTIFUL Jesu, O sweet saviour, O Christ the son of God, have pity upon me, mercifully hear me, and despise not my prayers. Thou hast created me of nothing, thou hast redeemed me from the bondage of sin, death, and hell, nether [neither] with gold nor silver, but with thy most precious body once offred upon the cross, and thine own blood shed once for al for my ransom : therefore cast me not away, whom thou by thy great wisdom haste made : despise me not, whom ye hast redeemed with such a precious treasure. Nor let my wickedness destroy that, which thy goodness hath builded. Now whiles I live, O Jesu have mercy on me, for if I dye out of thy favour, it will be to late afterword to cal for thy mercy : whiles I have time to repent, loke upon me with thy merciful eyes, as thou did vouchsafe to loke upon Peter thine Apostle, that I may bewail my sinful life, and obtain thy favour, and die therein. I reknowledge [acknowledge], that if thou shouldest deal with me according to very justice, I have deserved everlasting death. Therefore I appel to thy high throne of mercy trusting to obtain Gods favour, not for my merits, but for thy merits, O Jesu, who hast given thy self an acceptable sacrifice to thy father, to appease his wrath, and to bring all sinners, (truly repenting and amending their evil life) into his favour again. Accept me, O lord, among the number of them that shall be saved, forgeve my sins, geve me grace to lead a godly and innocent life, grant me thy heavenly wisdom, inspire my heart with faith, hope, and charity ; geve me grace to bee humble in prosperity, patient in adversity, obedient to my rulers, faithful unto them that trust me, dealing truly with al men, to live chastely in wedlock, to abhor adultery, fornication, and al uncleanness, to doe good after my power unto al men, to hurt no man, that thy name may be glorified in me, during this present life, and that I afterword may obtain everlasting life, thorough [through] thy mercy, and ye merits of thy passion. Amen.

¶ Certain prayers, taken out of the service daily, used in the queens house.

ALMIGHTY God, the Father of mercy, and God of all comfort, the which only forgivest sin, forgive unto us our sins, good Lord, forgive unto us our sins ; that by the multitude of thy mercies they may be covered, and not imputed unto us, and by the operation of the holy Ghost, we may have power and strength hereafter to resist sin by our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ.

Monday.



O LORD GOD, which despisest not a contrite hart, and forget the sins and wickedness of a sinner, in what hour soever hee doth morn and lament his old manner of living : grant unto us (O Lord) true contrition of hart, that we may vehemently despise our sinful life past, and wholly be converted unto thee, by our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.



Tuesday.

O MERCIFUL FATHER, by whose power and strength wee may overcome our enemies both bodily and ghostly : grant unto us, O Lord, that, according to our promise made in our baptism, we may overcome the chief enemies of our soul, that is, the desires of the world, the pleasures of the flesh, and the suggestions of the wicked spirit ; and so after lead our lives in holiness and righteousness, that we may serve thee in spirit and truth, and that by our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.



Wednesday.

O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, which not only give every good and perfect gift, but also encreasest those gifts that thou hast given : we most humbly beseech thee, (merciful God) to increase in us the gift of faith, that we may truly believe in thee, and in thy promises made unto us; and that neither by our negligence, nor infirmity of the flesh, nor by grieveusnesse of temptation, neither by the subtle crafts and assaults of the devil [devil] wee bee driven from faith in the blood of our Saviour and Lord Iesus Christ. Amen.



Thursday.

GRANT unto us, O merciful God, (wee most heartily beseech thee), knowledge and true understanding of thy word, that all ignorance expelled, we may know what thy will and pleasure is in all things, and how to doe our duties, and truly to walk in our vocation, and that also we may express in our living, those things that we doe know, that we be not only knowers of thy word, good Lord, but also bee workers of the same : by our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.



Friday.

O ALMIGHTY God, which hast prepared everlasting life to all those that be thy faithful servaunts : grant unto us, Lord, sure hope of the life everlasting, that we, being in this miserable world, may have some taste and feeling of it in our hearts ; and that not by our deserving, but by the merits and deserving of our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

O MERCIFUL God, our only aide, succour, and strength at all times; grant unto us, O Lord, that in the time of prosperity we be not proud, and so forget thee, but that with our whole power and strength wee may cleave unto thee; and in the time of adversity, that wee fall not to infidelity and desperation, but that always with a constant faith we may call for help unto thee grant this, O Lord, for our advocates sake, and Saviour Jesus Christ.

Amen.



Sunday.

A prayer for trust in God.

THE beginning of the fall of man was trust in himself. The beginning of the restoring of man, was distrust in himself, and trust in God. O most gracious and most wise guide, our Saviour Christ, which doest lead them the right way to immortal blessedness, which truly and unfeignedly trusting in thee, commit themselves to thee : Grant us, that like as we be blind and feeble in deed, so we may take and repute our selves, that we presume not of ourselves, to see to ourselves, but so far to see, that always wee may have thee before our eyes, to follow thee, being our guide, to bee ready at thy call most obediently, and to commit our selves wholly unto thee; that thou, which only know the way, may lead us the same way unto our heavenly desires; to thee with the Father and the holy Ghost be glory for ever.

A prayer for the concorde of Christ's church.

ARISE Lord, let thine enemies be scattered, thy haters put to flight, the righteous and Christ's disciples make pleasant and merry, let them sing praises and pleasant songs unto thee, let them blow abroad thy magnificence, let them most highly advance [advance] thy majesty, let thy glory grow, let the kingdom of Christ from heaven among the chosen be enlarged : bee thou the father of the fatherless, the judge of the widows, and the protector of them, namely [=especially] whom the world forsakes, whose consciences be troubled, whom the world pursues for Christ's sake, which be noddy and wrapped full of misery. In thy house O lord, let us dwell in peace and concord, geve us al one heart, one mind, one true interpretation upon thy word. Pluck of the bands, as well from the consciences as from the bodies of the miserable captives, and of them also which as yet bee hedged in within the lists [=boundaries] of death, and unadvisedly strive against grace. How dry (lord) is the flock of thine heritage! I pray thee, power [pour] down largely the showers of thy graces, let a more plenteous fruitefulnes chance, let thy people be strengthened with thy spirit : Grant us lord thy word abundantly, so that there may be many preachers of thy Gospel, which may within them selves holily conspire and agree. Let the church, the spouse of Christ, deal large spoils of the conquered Satan. All that believe in thee, by Christ (O lord God of health), mought [might] lift thee up with praises, might rename [=bring fame to] thee and extol thee. We bee entered into the voyage of salvation. Conduct us luckily unto the port, that being delivered by thee from the very death, we may escape and come to the very life. Finish the thing that thou hast begone in us, make us to increase from faith to faith, leave us not to our own will and choice, for it is slippery and ready to fall. To the thunderbolts of thy word put violence, that we may geve the glory to thee lonely. Geve to thy people courage and power to withstand sin, and to obeye thy word in all things : O Lord God most glorious and excellent over all.



1567

A prayer against the enemies of Christ's truth.

DELIVER me O Lord, from the ungodly and stiffenecked persons, for thou see how in their hearts they imagine mischief, and have great pleasure to pick quarrels, their tongues bee more sharpe than any adders sting, and under their lips lurks poison of adders. But, O merciful Lord, let me not fall into their hands, that they handle not me after their own lusts. Thou only art my God, thou must hear my pieteous plaint : Lord, that rulest al together, that art the strength and power of my defence, bee thou as a sallet [=helmet] on my head whenever the ungodly shall assault me : neither suffer thou not the wicked thus to prosper in their matters. Suffer not their crooked and malicious stomachs to increase, and spitefully revile thee. Loke upon thy pore wretches cause, and rid me out of these daily grievances, then shall I with a right up heart and pleasant countenance extol and magnify thy holy name. Amen.



1567

A prayer for patience in trouble.

HOW hast thou (O Lord) humbled and plucked me down. I dare now uneths [=scarcely] make my prayers unto thee, for thou art angry with me, but not without my deserving. Certainly I have sinned, Lord, I confess it; I will not deny it; but, oh my God, pardon my trespasses, release my debts, render now thy grace again unto me, stop my wounds, for I am all to plagued and beaten: yet Lord this notwithstanding I abide patiently, and give mine attendance on thee, continually waiting for relief at thy hand, and that not without skill; for I have received a token of thy favour and grace towards me, I mean thy word of promise concerning Christ, who for me was offered on the Cross for a ransom, a sacrifice and price for my sins : wherefore, acccording to that thy promise, defend me Lord by thy right hand, and give a gracious ear to my requests, for al mans stays are but vain. Beat down therefore mine enemies thine own self with thy power, which art mine only ayder and protector, O Lord God almighty. Amen.

A prayer to be said at night going to bed.

O MERCIFUL Lord God, heavenly Father, whether we sleep or wake, live or die, we are always thine. Wherefore I beseech thee heartily that thou wilt vouchsafe to take care and charge of me, and not to suffer me to perish in the works of darkness, but to kindle the light of thy countenance in my heart, that thy godly knowledge may daily increase in me, through a right and pure faith, and that I may always bee found to wake and live after thy will and pleasure, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Amen.



1567, 1599

¶ A prayer to be said at the hour of death.

O LORD Jesus, which art the only health of all men living, and the everlasting life of them which die in faith : I wretched sinner give and commit my self wholly unto thy most blessed will. And I being sure that the thing cannot perish which is committed unto thy mercy, willingly now I leave this frail and wicked flesh, in hope of the resurrection, which in better wise shall restore it to me again. I beseech thee, most merciful Lord Jesus Christ, that thou wilt by thy grace make strong my soul against all temptations, and that thou wilt cover and defend me with the buckler of thy mercy against al the assaults of the devil [devil]. I see and knowledge [acknowledge], that there is in myself no help of salvation, but all my confidence, hope, and trust, is in thy most merciful goodness. I have no merits, nor good works, which I may allege before thee. Of sins and evil works (alas) I see a great heap, but through thy mercy, I trust to bee in the number of them, to whom thou wilt not impute their sins, but take and accept me for righteous and just, and to bee the inheritor of everlasting life. Thou, merciful Lord, was borne for my sake, thou did suffer both hunger and thirst for my sake, thou did preach and teach, thou did pray and fast for my sake, thou did all good works and deeds for my sake, thou suffered most grievous pains and torments for my sake : And finally thou gave thy most precious body to die, and thy blood to bee shed on the cross for my sake. Now most merciful Saviour, let all these things profit me, which thou freely hast given me, that hast given thy self for me. Let thy blood cleanse and wash away the spots and foulness of my sins. Let thy righteousness hide and cover my unrighteousness. Let the merits of thy passion and blood, bee the satisfaction for my sins. Give me Lord thy grace, that my faith and salvation in thy blood waver not in me, but be ever firm and constant, that the hope of thy mercy and life everlasting never decay in me, that charity wax not cold in me. Finally, that the weakness of my flesh bee not overcome with the fear of death. Grant me, merciful Saviour, that when death hath shut up the eyes of my body, yet that the eyes of my soul may still behold and look upon thee : that when death hath taken away the use of my tongue and speech, yet that my heart may cry and say unto thee, In manus tuas, Domino, commando spiritum meum (that is to say) O Lord, into thy hands I give and commit my soul : Domino Iesu, accipe spiritum meum : Lord Iesu, receive my soul unto thee, Amen. Amen.



1567, 1599

¶ Another prayer for the Morning

O Almighty and most gracious God, we heartily thank thee for the sweet sleep and comfortable rest which thou hast given us this night : and forasmuch as thou hast commanded by thy holy Word, that no man should be idle, but all occupied in godly and virtuous exercises, every man according to his calling : we most humbly beseech thee, that thine eyes may attend upon us, daily defend us, cherish, comfort, and govern us and all our counsels [=deliberations], studies, and labours, in such wise, that wee may spend and bestow this day according to thy most holy will, without the hurting of our neighbours, and that wee may diligently and warily eschew and avoid all things that should displease thee, set thee always before our eyes, live in thy fear, working that which may bee found acceptable before thy divine Majesty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.



1634

¶ A prayer for the Evening

O Most mighty Lord our Father, and God everlasting, full of pity and compassion, we acknowledge and confess, that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to present our selves before thy Majesty, with confidence that thou wilt hear our prayers, and grant our requests, if we consider our own deserving : For our consciences doe accuse us, and our sins witness against us, and we know that thou art an upright Judge, which doest not justify the sinners and wicked men, but punishest the faults of such as transgress thy Commandments. Yet most merciful Father, sith [=since] it hath pleased thee to command us to call upon thee in all out troubles and adversities, promising even then to help us, when we feel our selves (as it were) swallowed up by death and desperation : wee utterly renounce all wordly confidence, & flee to thy Soveragine bounty, as our only stay and refuge, beseeching thee not to call to remembrance our manifold sins and wickedness, whereby we continually provoke thy wrath and indignation against us, neither our negligence & unkindness, which have neither worthily esteemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet comfort of thy Gospel revealed unto us, but rather accept the obedience and death of thy Son Jesus Christ, who by offering by his body in sacrifice once for all, hath made sufficient recompense for all our sins. Have mercy therefore upon us, O Lord, and forgive us our offences. Teach us by thy holy Spirit, that we may rightly weigh them, and earnestly repent for the same : and so much the rather, O Lord, because that the reprobate, and such as thou hast forsaken, cannot praise thee, nor call upon thy Name : but the repenting heart, the sorrowful mind, the conscience oppressed, hungring and thirsting for thy grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and glory. And albeit wee be but worms and dust, yet thou art our Creator, and wee be the work of thine hands : yea, thou art our Father, and we thy children : thou art our Shepherd, and wee thy flock : thou art our Redeemer, and we thy people whom thou hast bought : thou art our God, and wee thine inheritance. Correct us not therefoe in thy anger, O Lord, neither according to our deserts punish us, but mercifully chastise us with a fatherly affection, that all the world may know that at what time soever a sinner doth repent him of his sin from the bottom of his heart, thou wilt put away his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as thou hast promised by thine holy Prophet.

Finally, forasmuch as it has pleased thee to make the night for man to rest in, as thou hast ordained him the day to travail [toil] in : Grant, O dear Father, that we may so take our bodily rest, that our souls may continually watch for ye time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our deliverance out of this mortal life, and in the mean season, that we, not overcome by any fantasies, dreams, or other temptations, may fully set our minds upon thee, love thee, fear [=revere] thee, and rest in thee : Furthermore, that our sleep be not excessive, or overmuch, after the unsociable desires of our flesh : but only sufficient to content out weak nature, that wee may bee the better disposed to live in godly conversation [=behaviour], to the glory of thy holy Name, and profit of our brethren. Amen.



1634

¶ The prayer of Manasseth King of the Jewes.

O Lord Almighty, God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed, which hast made heaven and earth with all their ornament, which hast bound the Sea by the word of thy Commandment, which hast shut up the deep and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious Name, whom all doe fear, and tremble before thy power : for the Majesty of thy glory cannot bee borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable [=unendurable], but thy merciful promise is unmeasureable and unsearchable. For thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, long suffering, and most merciful and repentest for mans miseries. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hath promised* repentance and forgiveness to them that sin against thee, and for thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may bee saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not* sinned against thee, but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner. For I have sinned above the number of the sand of the Sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied : my transgressions are exceeding many : and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of the heavens for the multitude of mine unrighteousness. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have I any release : For I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee. I did not thy will, neither kept I thy Commandments. I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences. Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my transgressions : but I humbly beseech thee, forgive me : O Lord forgive me, & destroy me not with my transgressions. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me, neither condemn me unto the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent : and in me thou wilt show all thy goodness : for thou wilt save me that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy : therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life. For all the powers of the heavens praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

* Thou hast promised that repentance shall be the way for them to return to thee.

* He speaks this in compassion of himself and those holy Fathers which have their commemorations in the Scriptures, so that in respect of himself, he calls their sins nothing but attributeth unto them righteousness.



¶ A Prayer containing the duty of every true Christian

O Most mighty GOD, merciful and loving Father, I wretched sinner come unto thee in the Name of thy dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ my only Saviour and Redeemer : and I most humbly beseech thee for his sake to bee merciful unto me, and to cast all my sins out of thy sight and remembrance through the merits of his bloody death and Passion. Power [Pour] upon me (O Lord) the holy Spirit of wisdom and grace : govern and lead me by thy holy word, that it may be a lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my steps. Show thy mercy upon me, and so lighten my natural blindness and darkness of my heart through thy grace, that I may daily be renewed by the same Spirit and grace : By the which (O Lord) purge the grossenesse [=coarseness] of my hearing and understanding, that I may profitably read, hear, and understand the word and heavenly will, believe, and practise the same in my life and conversation [=behaviour], and evermore hold fast that blessed hope of everlasting life.

Mortify and kill all vice in me, that my life may express my faith in thee : mercifully hear the humble suit of thy servant, and grant me thy peace all my days : Graciously pardon my infirmities, and defend me in all dangers of body, goods and name : but most chiefly my soul against all assaults, temptations, accusations, subtle baits, and sleights of that old enemy of mankind, Satan that roaring Lion, ever seeking whom he may devour.

And here (O Lord) I prostrate with most humble mind, crave of thy divine Majesty, to bee merciful unto the universal Church of thy Son Christ : and specially according to my bounden duty, beseech thee for his sake to bless, save, and defend the principal member thereof, thy servant our most dear and Sovereign Lord King Charles, increase in his Royal heart true faith, godly zeal, and love of the same : And grant him victory over all his enemies, a long, prosperous, and honourable life upon earth, a blessed end, and life everlasting.

Moreover, O Lord, grant unto his Majesties most honourable Counsailers, and every other member of this Church of England, that they and wee in our several callings, may truly and godly serve thee : Plant in our hearts true fear and honour of thy Name, obedience to our Prince, and love to our neighbours : Increase in us true Faith and Religion : Replenish our minds with goodness, and of thy great mercy keep us in the same, till the end of our lives : Give unto us a godly zeal in prayer, true humility in prosperity, perfect patience in adversity, and continual joy in the holy Ghost.

And lastly, I commend unto thy Fatherly protection, all that thou hast given me, as wife, children, and servants : Aid me, O Lord, that I may govern, nourish, and bring them up in thy fear and service. And forasmuch as in this world I must always be at war and strife, not with one sort of enemies, but with an infinite number, not only with one flesh and blood, but with the devil which is the prince of darkness, and with which wicked men executors of his most damnable will : Grant me therefore thy grace, that being armed with thy defence, I may stand in the battle with an invincible constancy against all corruption which I am compassed with on every side, until such time as I having ended the combat, which during this life, I must sustain, in the end I may attain to thy heavenly rest, which is prepared for me and all thine Elect, through Christ our Lord and only Saviour. Amen.

FIRST, the banes [banns] must be asked three several Sondaies or holy days, in the time of service, the people being present, after the accustomed manner.

And if the persons that would be married dwell in diverse Paryshes, the banes must be asked in both Parishes and the Curate of the one Parish shall not solemnize matrimony betwixt them, without a certificate of the banes being thryse asked, from the Curate of the other Parish. At the date appointed for solempnizacyon of Matrimony, the persons to be married shall come into the body of the Church, with their friends and neighbours. And there the Priest shall thus say.

DEARLY beloved friends, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of his congregacion, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable state, instituted of God in Paradise, in the time of manes innocence, signiflyng unto us the mistical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church: which holy state Christ adorned and beautified with his presence and first miracle that he wrought in Cana of Galile, and is commended of saint Paul to be honourable among all men, and therefore is not to be enterprised, nor taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly, to satisfy men carnal lusts and appetites, like brute beasts that have no understanding ; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God, duly considering the causes for the which matrimony was ordained. One was the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurtoure of the Lord, and praise of God. Secondly, it was ordained for a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication, that such persons as have not the gift of continence might mary, and keep themselves undefiled members of Christ's body. Thirdly, for the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity, into the which holy state these two persons present, come now to be joined. Therefore if any man can show any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

And also speaking to the persons that shall be married, he shall sale.

I REQUIRE and charge you (as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgement, when the secretes of all hearts shall be disclosed) that if either of you doe know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in Matrimony, that ye confess it. For be ye well assured, that so many as be coupled together, otherwise than Gods word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their Matrimony lawful.

At which day of Marriage, if any man do allege and declare any impediment, why they may not be coupled together in matrimony by Gods law, or the laws of this realm, and will be bound, and sufficient sureties with him to the parties, or else put in a cautyon to the full value of such charges, as the persons to be married do sustain to prove his allegation: then the solempnization must be deferred unto such time as the truth be tried. If no impediment be alleged, then shall the curate say unto the man,

N. WILT thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to lyve together after Gods ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Will thou love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness, and in health? And forsaking al other, keep the only to her, so long as you both shall hue?

The man shall answer,

I will.

Then shall the Priest say to the woman,

N. WILT thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to lyve together after Gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? wilt thou obey him and serve him, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness and in health? And forsaking al other, keep the only to him so long as ye both shall live

The woman shall answer,

I will.

Then shall the Minister say,

Who gives this woman to be married unto this man?

¶ And the Minister receiving the woman at her father or friends hands, shall cause the man to take the woman by the right hand, and so either to geve their troth to other, the man first saying.

I N. take the. N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for porer, in sickness, and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us depart; according to Gods holy ordinance, and thereto I plight the my troth.

Then shall they louse their hands, and the woman taking again the man by the right hand, shall say.

I N. take the. N. to my wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness, ad in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us depart, according to gods holy ordinance: and thereto I geve the my troth.





Then shall they again louse their hands, and the man shall geve unto the woman a ring, laying the same upon the book, with the accustomed duty to the Priest and Clerk. And the Priest taking the ring, shall deliver it unto the man, to put it upon the fourth finger of the women's left hand. And the man taught by the Priest, shall say.

WITH this ring I the wed: with my body I the worship: and with all my worldly goods, I the endow. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

Then the man leaving the ring upon the fourth finger of the women's left hand, the Minister shall say.

O ETERNAL God, creator and preserver of all mankind, giver of all spiritual grace, the author of everlasting life: send thy blessing upon these thy servauntes, this man and this woman, whom we bless in thy name, that as Isaac and Rebecca lyved faithfully together: So these persons may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made, whereof this ring given, and received, is a token and pledge, and may ever remain in perfect love and peace together, and live according unto thy laws, thorough Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ Then thai the Priest join their right hands together and say.

Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put a condor.

Then shall the Minister speak unto the people.

FOR as much as .N. and .N. have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God, and this company, and thereto have given and pledged, their troth either to other, and have declared the same by gevyyng and receiving of a ring, and by joining of hands I pronounce that they be man and wife together. In the name of the father, of the son and of the holy Ghost. Amen.

And the Minister shall add this blessing.

GOD the Father, God the Son, God the holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you, the Lord mercifully with his favour loke upon you, and so fill you with al spiritual benediction, and grace, that you may so lyve together in this life, that in the world to come, you may have life everlasting. Amen.

¶ Then the Ministers or Clerckes going to the Lords table, shall say, or sing this Psalm following Beati omnes.





BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord, and walk in his ways.

For thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands, O well is the, and happy shalt thou be.

Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine upon the walls of thy house.

Thy children like the olive branches round about thy table.

Lo thus shall the man be blessed: that fears the lord.

The Lord from out of Zion shall bless the: that thou shalt see Hierusalem in prosperity, al thy life long:

Yea, that thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace upon Israel.

Glory be to the. &c.

As it was. &c.



Psal. cxxviii.

Or else this Psaime following Deus misereatur.

GOD be merciful unto us and bless us: and show us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us.

That thy way may be known upon the earth: thy savyng health among al nations.

Let the people praise the (O God) yea, let all the people praise the.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad, for thou shalt judge the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon the earth.

Let the people praise the (O God) let all the people praise the.

Then shall the earth bring furthe her increase, and God, even our God, shall geve us his blessing.

God shall bless us, and al the ends of the world shall fear him.

Glory be to the Father. &c.

As it was in the be. &c.

The Psaime ended, and the man and the woman knelyng before the Lords table: The Priest standing at the Table, and turning his face toward them, shall say,



Lord have mercy upon us.

Answer. Christ have mercy upon us.

Minister. Lord have mercy upon us.

OUR FATHER WHICH ART. &c.

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Minister. O Lord, save thy servant, and thy handmaid.

Answer. Which put their trust in the.

Minister. O Lord send them help from thy holy place.

Answer. And evermore defend them.

Minister. Be unto them a tower of strength.

Answer. From the face of their enemy.

Minister. O Lord hear our prayer.

Answer. And let our cry come unto the.

¶ The Minister.

O GOD of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless these thy servauntes, and sow the sede of eternal life in their minds, that whatsoever in thy holy word they shall profitably learn, they may in dede fulfil the same. Loke, O Lord mercifully upon them from heaven, and bless them. And as thou did send thy blessing upon Abraham and Sara to their great comfort: so vouchesaufe to send thy blessing upon these thy servauntes, that they obeiyng thy will, and always being in safety under thy protection, may abide in thy love unto their lives end, through Jesu Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ This prayer next following shall be omitted where the woman is past chide birth.

O MERCIFUL Lord, and heavenly Father, by whose gracious gift mankind is increased, we beseech the assist with thy blessing these two persons, that they may both be fruitful in procreation of children, also live together so long in godly love and honesty, that they may see their childers children, unto the third and fourth generation unto thy praise and honour: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

O GOD which by thy mighty power hast made all things of nought, which also after other things set in ordre, did appoinct that out of man (created after thine own image and similitude) woman should take her beginning, and knitting them together, did teach that it should never be lawful to put a condor those, whom thou by matrimony had made one: O God which haste consecrated the state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery, that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Chniste and his Church: Loke mercifully upon these thy servauntes, that both this man may love his wife, according to thy word (as Christ did love his spouse the Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it, even as his own flesh). And also that this woman may be loving and amiable to her husband as Rachel, wise as Rebecca, faithful and obedient as Sara, and in all quietness, sobriety, and peace, be a folower of holy and Godly matrons, O Lord bless them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

¶ Then shall the Priest say,

ALMIGHTY God, which, at the beginning did create our first parents Adam and Eve, and did sanctify and join them together in marriage, power upon you the riches of his grace, sanctify, and bless you, that ye may please him both in body and soul, and live together in holy love, unto your lives end. Amen.

Then shall begin the Communion, and after the Gospel shall be said a Sermon, wherein ordinarily (so oft as there is any marriage) thoffice of a man and wife shall be declared, according to holy Scripture, or if there be no sermon, the Minister shall read this that follows.

AL ye which be married, on which entend to take the holy estate of Matrimony upon you: hear what holy scripture doth say, as touching the duty of husbands toward their wives, and wives toward their husbands.

Saint Paul (in his Epistle to the Ephesians, the v Chapiter) doth geve this commandment to all married men.

Ye husbands love your wives, even as Christ loved the Church, and hath given himself for it, to sanctify it, purging it in the fountain of water, through the word, that he might make it unto him self a glorious congregacion, not havyng spot or wrincle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and blameless. So men are bound to love their own wives, as their own bodies. He that loves his own wife loves him self. For never did any man hate his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Land doth the congregacion, for we are members of his body: of his flesh and of his bones.

For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak of Christ and of the congregacion. Nevertheless, let every one of you so love his own wife, even as him self.



Psal. lxvii.



Likewise the same saint Paule (writing to the Collossians) speaks thus to all men that be married. Ye men, love your wives, and be not bitter unto them.

Solos iii.

Hear also what saint Peter Thaposthe of Christ, which was him self a married man (saith unto al men) that are married. Ye husbands, dwell with your wives according to knowledge. Gevynge honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel, and as heirs together of the grace of life, so that your prayers be not hindered.

Hitherto ye have heard the duty of the husband toward the wife.

Now likewise ye wives hear and learn your duty toward your husbands, even as it is plainly set furs in holy scripture.



i. Pet. iii.

Saint Paule (in the forenamed Epistle to the Ephesians) teaches you thus: Ye women, submit your selfes unto your own husbands as unto the Lord: for the husband is the wives headde, even as Christ is the headde of the Church. And he is also the savioure of the whole body. Therefore as the Church or congregacion, is subject unto Christ. So likewise let the wives also be in subjection unto their own husbands in al things. And again he says : Let the wife reverence her husband. And (in his Epistle to the Collossians) Saint Paule gives you this short lesson, Ye wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as it is convenient in the Lord.

Ephe. v.





Col. iii.



Saint Peter also doth instruct you very godly, thus saiynge, Let wives be subject to their own husbands, so that if any obey not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation [=behavior] of the wives, while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear, whose apparel let it not be outward, with broided [braided] hair and trimming about with gold, either in putting on of gorgeous apparel, but let the hid manne which is in the heart, be without all corruption, so that the spirit be mild and quiet, which is a precious thing in the sight of God. For after this manner (in the old time) did the holy women which trusted in God apparel them selves, being subject to their own husbands, as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord; whose daughters ye are made, doing well, and baying not dismayed with any fear.

The new married persons (the same day of their marriage) must receive the holy Communion.

i. Pet. iii.

¶ THE ORDER FOR THE

VISITATION OF THE SICK.



The Priest entering into the sick persons house, shall say.

Peace be in* this house, and to all that dwell in it.

When he comes into the sick man presence, he shall say knelynge down.

REMEMBER not Lord our iniquities, nor the iniquities of our forefathers. Spare us good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood and bee not angry with us for ever.

Lord have mercy upon us.

Christ have mercy upon us.

Lord have mercy upon us.

¶ Our father which art in heaven. &c

And lead us not into temptation.

Answer. But deliver us from evel. Amen.

¶ Minister. O Lord save thy servant.

¶ Answer. Which puts his trust in the.

¶ Minister. Send him help from thy holy place.

¶ Answer. And evermore mightily defend him.

¶ Minister. Let the enemy have none advantage of him.

¶ Answer. Nor the wicked approach to hurt him.

¶ Minister. Be unto him O Lord a strong Tower.

¶ Answer. From the face of his enemy.

¶ Minister. Lord hear our prayers.

¶ Answer. And let our cry come unto the.

¶ Minister,

O Lord loke down from Heaven, behold, visit, and relive this thy servant. Loke upon him with the eyes of thy mercy, geve him comfort and sure confidence in the, defend him from the danger of the enemy, and keep him in perpetual peace, and safety: Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

HEAR us almighty, and most merciful God, and saviour, extend thy accustomed goodness, to this thy servant which is greved with sickness, visit him O Lord, as thou did visit Peters wives mother, and the capiteines servant. So visit and restore unto this sick person his former health (if it bee thy will) or else geve him grace so to take thy visitation, that after this painful life ended, he may dwell with the in life everlasting. Amen.

¶ Then shall the Minister exhort the sick person after this form or other like.





* "to" in early 1600's.



DEARLY beloved know this, that almighty god is the lord of life and death, and over al things to them pertaining, as youth, strength, helthe, age weakness, and sickness, wherefore, whatsoever your sickness is, know you certainly, that it is Gods visitation. And for what cause soever this sickness is sent unto you: whether it bee to try your patience for the example of other, and that your faith may be found in the dai of the lord laudable, glorious, and honourable, to the increase of Glory, and endless felicity: Or else it be sent unto you, to correct, and amend in you whatsoever doth offend the eyes of our heavenly father: know you certainly, that if you truly repent you of your sins, and bear your sickness patiently, trusting in Gods mercy for his dere son Jesus Christ's sake, and rendre unto him humble thanks for his fatherly visitation, submitting your self wholly to his will, it shall turn to your profit, and help you forward in the right way that leads unto everlasting life*. Take therefore in good worth, the chastemente of the lord, for whom the lord loves he chastises. yea, as S. Paul saith, he scourges every son which he receives : If you endure chastisement, he offers himself unto you as unto his own children. What son is he that the father chastises not? If ye be not under correction (whereof all true children are partakers) then are ye bastards, and not children. Therefore saying, that when our carnal fathers do correct us, we reverently obey them, shall we not now much rather be obedient to our spiritual father, and so live? And they for a few days do chastise us after their own pleasure, but he doth chastise us for our profit to the intent he may make us partakers of his holiness. These words good brother, are Gods words, and written in holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction, that we should patiently and with thankesgeving, bear our heavenly fathers Correction, whenever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us. And there should be no greater comfort to christian persons, than to be made like unto christ, by suffering patiently adversities, troubles, and Sickenesses. For he him self went not up to joy, but first he suffered pain : hee entered not into his glory, before he was crucified: So truly our way to eternal joy, is to suffer here with Christ, and our door to entry into eternal life: is gladly to die with Christ, that we may rise again from death and dwell with him in everlasting life. Now therefore, taking your sickness, which is thus profitable for you patiently: I exhort you in the name of God, to rernembre the profession which you made unto God, in your Baptism. And forasmuch as after this life there is account [account] to be given unto the rightuous judge, of whom all must be judged without respect of persons: I require you to examine your self and your state, both toward God and man, so that accusing and condempning your self for your own faults, you may find mercy at our heavenly fathers hand, for Christ's sake, and not be accused and condemned in that fearful judgement. Therefore I shall shortly rehearse the Articles of our faith, that ye may know whether you do believe as a Christian man should, or no.

¶ Here the minister shall rekerse the articles of the faith saying thus DOEST thou believe in God the father almighty.

And so furs, as it is in Baptism.

1559:





*If the person visited be very sick then the Curate may end his exhortacion in this place.



¶	Then shall the minister examine whether he be in charity, with all the world: exhorting him to forgive from the bottom of his hart, al persons that have offended him, and if he have offended other, to ask them forgiveness; And where he has done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amends to the uttermost of his power. And if he have not before disposed his goods, let him the make his will. (But men must be oft admonished that they set an order for their temporal goods and lands,when they be in health.) And also declare his debts, what hee owes, and what is owing unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietness ofhis executors. The minister may not forget, nor omit to move the sick person (and that most earnestly) to liberality lowarde the poor.

From late 1500's:



This may be done before the minister begin his prayers as he shall se cause.



¶	Then shall the minister examine whether he be in charity, with all the world, exhorting him to forgive from the bottom of his heart all persons that have offended him, and if he have offended other, to ask them forgiveness: and where hee hath done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amends to the uttermost of his power. And if he have not before disposed his goods, let him the make his will, and also declare his debts, what he owes, and what is owing unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietness of his Executors. But men must be oft admonished that they set an order for their temporal goods and lands, when they be in health.

¶	These words before rehearsed, may bee said before the Minister begin his prayer, as he shall see cause.

¶	The minister may not forget, nor omit to move the sick person (and that most earnestly) to liberality loward the poor.

¶	Here shall the sick person make a special confession, if he feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter. After which confession the priest shall absolve him after this sort.

OUR Lord Jesus Christ who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners, which truly repent, and believe in him: of his great mercy forgeve thine offences, and by his authority committed to me, I absolve the from al thy sins. In the name of the father and of the son &c. Amen.

¶ And then the priest shall say the Collect following.

¶ Let us pray.

O MOST merciful God, which according to the multitude of thy mercies, dost so put away the sins of those which truly repent, that thou remebrest them no more, open thy eye of mercy upon this thy servant, who most earnestly desires pardon, and forgiveness. Renew in him most lovying father, whatsoever hath been decayed, by the fraud, and malice of the devil, or by his own carnal will, and frailnes, preserve, and continue this sick membre in the unity of thy church, consider his contricion, accept his tears, assuage his pain, as shall be scene to thee most expedient for him. And forasmuch as he puts his full trust only in thy mercy, impute not unto him his former sins, but take him to thy favour, through the merits of thy most dearly beloved son Jesus Chriest. Amen.

¶ Then the Minister shall say this Psalm.





IN the, O Lord have I put my trust, let me never bee put to confusion, but rid me, and deliver me into thy ryghtuousnesse, incline thine ear unto me and save me.

Be thou my strong hold whereunto I may always resort: thou hast promised to help me, for thou art my house of defence, and my Castle.

Deliver me a my God out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the unrightuous and cruel man.

For thou O lord God art the thing that I long for : thou art my hope even from my youth.

Through the have I ben holden up ever sense I was borne: thou art he that toke me out of my mothers womb, my praise shall always be of the.

I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in the.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: (that I may sing of thy glory) and honour all the day lunge.

Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength fails me.

For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul, take their counsel together, saiynge: God hath forsaken him, persecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him.

Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste the to help me.

Let them be confounded and perish, that are against my soul: let them be covered with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.

As for me, I will pacietly abide always : and will praise the, more and more.

My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness, and salvation: for I know no end thereof.

I will go furs in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy righteousness only.

Thou (O God) haste taught me from my youth up until now: therefore I will tell of thy wondrous works.

Forsake me not (O God) in mine old age, when I am gray headed: until I have showed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yet for to come.

Thy righteousness (O God) is very high, and great things are they that thou haste done: O God, who is like unto the?

O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me? and yet did thou turn and refresh me, yea, and brought me from the deep of the earth again.

Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.

Therefore will I praise the and thy faythefulnes (O God) plaiynge upon an instrument of Music: unto the will I singe upon the Harp, O thou holy one of Israel.

My lips will be fine, when I sing unto the: and so will my soul whom thou hast delivered.

My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness al the day long : for they are confounded and brought unto shame, that seek to do me evil.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen.

Adding this.

O SAVIOUR of the world, save us, which by thy cross and precious blood hast redeemed us, help us we beseech the, O God.

¶ Then shall the Minister say.

THE almighty Lord; which is a most strong tower to all them that put their trust in him, to whom all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth doe bow and obey, be now; and evermore thy defence, and make the know and feel, that there is no other name under heaven given to man, in whom, and through whom thou may receive health and salvation, but only .the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

¶ THE



COMMUNION OF THE SICK.

Forasmuch as al mortal men be subject to many soubdein perils, diseases, and sicknesses, and ever uncertain what time they shall departs out of this lyf. Therefore to the intent they may be always in a readiness to die, whenever it that please Almighty God to cal them: The Curates shall diligently from time to time, but specially in the plague time, exhort their Parishioners to the oft receiving in the Church, of the holy Communion of the body and blood of our saviour Christ. Which (if they do) they shall have no cause in their soubdeine visitation to be unquieted for lacks of the same. But if the sick persons be not able to come to the Church, and yet is desirous to receive the Communion in his house, then ye must give knowledge over night, or else early in the Morning to the Curate, signifying also how many be appointed to communicate with him. And havyng a convenient place in the sick mans house, where the Curate may reverently minister, and a good number to receive the Communion with the sick persons, with all things necessary for the same, he that there minister the holy Communion.

The Collect.

ALMIGHTY everlivyng God, maker of mankind, which doest correct those whom thou doest love, and chastisest every one whom thou doest receive, we beseech the to have mercy upon this thy servant visited with thy hand, and to grant that he may take his sickness patiently, and recover his bodily health (if it be thy gracious will), and whenever his soul shall depart from the body, it may bee without spot presented unto the: Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.





The Epistle.

MY son, despise not the correction of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loves, him he corrects : yea, and he scourges every son whom he receives.





Hebr. xii.



The Gospel.

VERILY, verily I say unto you, he that hears my word, and beleveth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come unto dampnacion, but he passes from death unto life.

¶	At the time of the distribution of the holy Sacrament, the Priest shall flrst receive the Communion himself, and after minister unto them that be appointed to communicate with the sick.

¶	But if any man, either by reason of extremity of sickness, or for lack of warning in due time to the Curate, or for lack of company to receive with him, or by any other just impediment, do not receive the Sacrament of Christ's body and blood, then the Curate shall instruct him, that if he do truly repent him of his sins, and steadfastly believe that Jesus Christ hath sufred death upon the cross for him, and shed his blood for his redempcion, earnestly remembering the benefits he hath thereby, and giving him hearty thanks therefore, he doth eat and drink the body and blonde of our saviour Christ, profitably to his souls health, although he doe not receive the Sacrament with his mouth.

¶	When the sick person is visited, and receives the holy Communion al at one time, then the Priest, for more expedition, shall cut of the form of the visitation at the Psaime, In the, O Lord have I put my trust, and go straight to the Communion.

¶	In the time of plague, Sweat, or such other like contagious times of sickenesses or diseases, when none of the Paroshe or neighbours can be gotten to communicate with the sick in their houses, for fear of the infection, upon special request of the diseased, the minister may alonly communicate with him.

The collects and Bible readings for Holy Communion in the 1549, 1552, and 1559 Books of Common Prayer are, with some small exceptions, all identical among those three editions, and so are all given here together. The major difference is that only the 1549 Book has the Introit (or Psalm) appointed for each Sunday and Holy Day; this is omitted in the other books. Also, only the 1549 book has readings appointed for Matins (Morning Prayer) and Evensong (Evening Prayer) for certain Sundays and Holy Days; these are given in the Calendar for the other books.

The translation used is that of the Great Bible (a portion of which is pictured below), the first authorized English translation. This translation, compiled by Miles Coverdale, was closely based on the very first printed English translation, that of Tyndale. While the Epistles and Gospels were replaced by the "Authorized", or King James version for the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the Psalms given here, as translated by Coverdale, continued to be used in all editions of the Book of Common Prayer through the U.
