A Lamentation from Rome, how the Pope doth
bewail, That the Rebels in England can not prevail,
To the tune of Row well ye Mariners.
     ALl you that news would here,
Geve ear to me poor Fabyn Fly,
At Rome I was this year,
And in the Pope his nose did lye,
But there I could not long abide,
He blew me out of every side:
For first when he had harde the news,
That Rebels did their Prince misuse,
      Then he with joy,
     Did sport him self with many a toy,
      he then so stout,
     From that his nose he blew me out.

     But as he was asleep,
Into the same again I goot:
I crept there in so deep,
That I had almost burnt my coote,
New news to him was brought that night.
The Rebels they wear put to flight,
But Lord how then the Pope toke one,
And called for a Mary bone,
      up howgh make hast:
     My lovers all be like to waste,
      rise Cardinal, up priest,
     Saint Peter he doth what he lest.

     So then they fell to Mess,
The Fryers one their Beads did pray,
The Pope began to bless,
At last he weist not what to say.
It chanced so the next day morn,
A Post came blowing of his Horn,
Saying Northomberland is take,
But then the Pope began to quake.
      he then rubbed nose,
     With Pilgrome salve be noynt his hose,
      run here, run there,
     His nails for anger began to pare.

     Not Northomberland alone,
But many of his wicked aid:
Such as thought not to groan,
They hoped well for to aplayd,
There parts to have there hearts desire,
But now is quenched there flames of fire,
The greatest and the mean beside,
With other youths fast bound must ride,
      Ketch fast, keep well,
     There youthful blood they long to sell,
      trust this dere Pope,
     What is it than wherefore ye hope.

     When he perceived well,
The news was true to him was brought,
Upon his knees he fell,
And then Saint Peter he be sought,
That he would stand his friend in this,
To help to aid those servauntes his,
And he would do as much for him,
But Peter sent him to Saint Simme.

      So then he snuffed,
     the Fryers all about he cuft,
      He roared he cried,
     the priests they durst not once abide.

     The Cardnalles they begins,
To stay and take him in there arm,
He spurnd them on the shins,
Away the trudgd for fear of harm.
So there the pope was left alone,
Good Lord how he did make his moan,
The Stools against the Walls he threw,
And me out of his nose he blew.
      I hopt I skipped,
     From place to place about I whipped,
      he swore he tare,
     Till from his Crown he bold the hear.

     He coursed me so about,
In the house I could find no rome,
Loath I was to go out,
And shrind my self under a Brom.
Then by and by down he was set,
with anger he was one a sweat,
He rubbed his elbow on the Wall,
So fell a railing on Saint Paule.
      Fie fie blood heart,
     He scratched him self till he did smart,
      poll nose rube eye,
     Grash the teeth draw mouth awry.

     He wept and wrong his hands,
yea worse and worse began to fret:
Thus ridging still he stands,
then out at door I did me get,
I was not sooner gone from thence,
But worse and worse was his pretence,
The post he plucked from the house,
he left no harbour for a Mouse,
      thus now the popes mad.
     Because no better luck they had,
      forlorn molest,
     that they so ill their meat digest.

     When I had viewed all,
To bring this news my wings I spread,
to this parplict he is fall.
I wish some would go hold his head.
For certainly he doth ill fare,
yet for the same I do not care,
For God his power will convince,
And aid with right his beloved prince.
      then Pope ridge thou,
     The God in heaven hath made avow,
      to keep all his,
     That God is just our stay he is.
