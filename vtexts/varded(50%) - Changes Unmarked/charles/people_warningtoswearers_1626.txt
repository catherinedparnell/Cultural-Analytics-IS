A Warning for Swearers and Blasphemers.
Showing Gods fearful Judgements against divers for profaning his holy name by swearing.
Necessary to be set up and read in every house, for the avoiding of Oaths.


THou that these Lines dost either hear or read,
Consider with thy self, and take good heed.
Read them, and let them never be forgot.
They doe concern thy Soul, then slight them not.
Thea Fiends of hell believe there is a God,
And fear and tremble at his angry Rod:
They doe confess his glorious Excellence,
And his almighty Powers Omnipotence.
But Man his choicest, and his chiefest Creature,
Is so rebellious against God and Nature,
That he against Heaven dares both blaspheme and swear
And (worse then Fiends) they not believe or fear:
So that the Earth doth breed, feed, and retain
Worse Monsters, then there doth in Hell remain.
If men believed the word that God hath spoke,
They would believe that word should ne'er be broke.
In His enacted Lawb is one Decree,
That all who take his Name in vain, shall be
Accounted guilty, and his fearful wrath
Will hold them worthy of eternal death.
Again, it is said, Letc the Blasphemer dye,
Let him be stoned for his Blasphemy.
And evil tongues, who dare to Curse adventer,
Shall into Heavensd blessedness not enter.
And Christ (when on the eareth he lived here)
Forbade us thate at all we should not swear.
And in the eleventh of Deutronomony again,
We are commanded, not to swear in vain.

     Thef Heathen to blaspheme their gods abhorred,
Yet Christians wilfully blaspheme the Lord.
Whoever to revile the gods were known,
In Rome, were from the Rock Tarpeius thrown.
The Egyptians Law was, he should lose his head.
Amongst Scithians, life and goods were forfeited.
These grievous punishments did Pagans use
Against all them that did their gods abuse.

     King Donalds Law in Scotland not forgot,
Who burnt them through the lip[s] with [i]rons hot.
And when King Edmond here had Regal state,
All Swearers he did excommunicate.
And Philip King of France (a Prince renownd)
Ordained that all Blasphemers should be drowned.
The Emperor Maximilian did decree
That all vain Swearers should beheaded be.
The Earl of Flanders, Philip did ordain,
Their loss of life and goods, that swore in vain.
Saint Lewis the King of France, enacted there
That for the first time any one did swear,
Into Imprisonment one month was cast,
And stand within the Pillory at last.
But if the second time again they swore,
One with an iron hot their tongues did bore.
And who the third time in that fault did slip
Were likewise board through the under-lip.
For the fourth time most grievous pains belongs,
He cause to be cut off their lips and tongues.
Henry the fifth of England, that good King,
His Court to such conformity did bring,
That every Duke should forty shillings pay
For every oath he swore,without delay.
Each Baron twenty, Knights or Esquires offence
Paid ten: and every Yeoman twenty pence.
The Boys and Pages all were whipped most fine,
That durst abuse the Majesty divine.

     Thus Pagan Princes with sharpe Laws with-stood
Profaning of their Gods of stone or wood.
And Christian Kings and Rulers formerly,
Have most severely punished Blasphemy.
And shall an Heathen or an Infidel,
That knows no joys of heaven, or pains of hell,
More reverence to his devilish Idols show,
Then we doe to the true God, whom wee know?
If we remember well but what we were,
And what we are, we would not dare to swear.
Poor trunks of Earth; filled with uncertain breath,
By nature, heirs to everlasting death,
Most miserable wretches, most ingrate
Against God, that did elect us, and create,
Redeemed, conserved, preserved, and sanctified,
And gives us hope we shall be glorified;
H' hath given us being, life, sense, reason, wit,
Wealth, and all things his providence thinks fit:

f GOD himself
complains that
men blaspheme
him, Essay.52.5.
The names of
blasphemy is writ
upon the 10 heads
of Antichrist, A-
pose. 13.1. Cursing
is forbidden by
[?] Apostle, when
[?]ith, Bless, I
say, and curse not.
Rome. 12.14. Our
Saviour comman-
death us to bless
them that curse
us, Matth. 5.44.
Bless them that
curse you, & pray
for them which
hurt you, Luke
6.28. Accustom
not thy mouth to
swearing, for in it
are many falls, nei-
there take up for a
custom the na-
ming of the holy
One, for thou
shalt not bee un
punished for such
things, Ecclesiasti-
cus; 23.9. The
plague shall never
go from the house
of the swearer. Id.
     Who so swears
falsely, calls the
God of Truth to
witness a lye. Who
so swears as hee
thinks, may be de-
ceived. Who so
swears unreve-
rently, dishonou-
reth God. Who so
swears deceitful
lie, abuses Chri-
stian fidelity. Who
so swears idly,
abuses the credit
of a lawful oath.
Who so swears ac-
customably, God
will plague.

And for requital we (quite void of grace)
Curse, swear, and blaspheme him to his face.
Oh the supernal patience of our God,
That bears with man (a sin-polluted clod)
When half such treasons against an earthly King
Would many a traitor to confusion bring!

     Suppose a man should take a Whelp and breed him
Should stroke him, and make much of him, and feed him
How will that Cur love him beyond all other:
Never forsaking him to serve another.
Ant if hee should most disobediently
Into his Masters face, or throat to fly,
Sure every man that lives upon the ground,
Would say, a hanging's fit for such a Hound.
And worser then so many dogs are they
That against their God with oaths doe bark and bray,
And if Repentance doe not Mercy win,
They'll hang in Hell like Hell-hounds for their sin.
Of all black crimes from Belzebubs damned treasure,
This Swearing sin no profit yields, nor pleasure:
Nor gains the Swearer here but Earths vexation,
With change of his salvation for damnation.
It is a sin that yields us no excuse,
(For what excuse can be for Gods abuse?)
And though our other faults by death doe end,
Yet Blasphemy doth after death extend,
For to the damned in Hell this curse is given,
They for their pains blasphemed the God of heaven.
Examples on the earth have many been
As late in sundry places have been seen.
At Mantua two brave Ruffians in their game,
Swore and blasphemed our blessed Saviours Name,
Where Gods just judgement (full of fear and dread)
Cause both their eyes to drop from out their head.
In Rome, a child but five years old, that swore,
Was snatched up by the Devil, and seen no more.
And at Ragouse, a Mariner did swear,
As if he would Gods name in sunder tear,
When falling overboard, was drowned and tossed,
And nothing but his tongue was only lost.
Remember this you sinful sons ofg Men,
Think how that Christ redeemed you from Hells den.
His mercy he hath given in multitude,
Requite him not with vile ingratitude:
He made the Ear and Eye, and hears and sees
The Swearers execrable oaths and lies.
The Godhood of the Father they contemn,
Against the Sons Redemption they blaspheme.
The Holy Spirit grievously they grieve,
And head-long into hell themselves they drive.
It is in vain for mortal men to think,
Gods Justice is asleep, although it wink.
Or that his arm is shortened in these times,
That hee cannot reach home to punish crimes.
Oh think not so, it is but the Devils illusion,
To draw us desperately to our confusion,
Some say, that it is their anger makes them swear,
And oaths are out before they are aware:
But being crossed with losses, and perplexed,
They think no harm, but swear as being vexed:
And some there are that swear for complement,
Make oaths their grace and speeches ornament,
Their sweet Rhetorical fine Eloquence,
Their Reputations only excellence.
Their valour, whom the Devil doth inflame
To abuse their Makers and Redeemers Name.
Think but of this, you that doe God forget,
Your poor excuses cannot pay this debt.
Remember that our sinful souls did cost
A price too great to be by swearing lost.
And blessed was our last good parliament,
Who made an Act for Swearers punishment,
And blessed shall be each Magistrates good name,
That carefully doth execute the same:
Those that are zealous for Gods glory here,
(No doubt) in heaven shall have true glory there.
Which that we may have, humbly I implore
Of Him that rules and reigns for evermore,
The Eternal Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,
Before whose Throne blessed Saints and Angels sings
All power, praise, glory, majesty, thansgiving,
Ascribed be to him that's ever-living.

g Alfred an Eng-
lish Earl, conspi-
ring to put out K.
Adelstanes eyes at
Winchester, for-
swear the treason
in Saint Peters
Church at Rome,
and fell down
dead presently.
Earl Godwin mur-
thered Prince Al-
fred brother to
king Edward Con-
fessor, and being at
dinner, the King
charged him with
the murder, then
Godwin swore by
bread, and prayed
it might choke
him if hee were
guilty, and imme-
diately it choked
him in the place:
his lands also sunk
into the sea, & are
called Godwin-
sands. K. Stephen
forswore himself
to King Henry I.
and lived in con-
tinuall trouble, &
died in perplexity
of mind. Edward
4. brake his oath,
made at York, that
he came not with
intent to seize the
Kingdom, and
breaking the oath,
was punished with a
troublesome reign,
his brethren and
children all (ex-
cept one) murthe-
red: and not any
of his issue reign
ed after him. To
ger Mortimer, a
great Peer of this
land, for breaking
his oath to King
Edward the 2. was
most ignominy
ously hanged, bo-
weld and quarte-
red. M. Fox in his
Book of Martyrs,
declares of one Ri-
chard Long of Ca-
lice, that forswore
himself to accuse
one Smith for ea-
ting flesh in Lent,
after which oath
Long went pre-
sently and drown
ed himself. One
Grimwood at Hit
cham in Suffolk
forswore himself,
and his bowels
burst out. One we
dow Barnes, for
the like sin cast
her self out of her
window in Corn
hill, and brake her
neck. Anne Ave-
ris forswore her
self in Woodstreet
for six pound of
Tow, desiring
God she sink
down, which fear-
fully happened: one
Lea in Sunne-alley
without Bishops
gate, forswore him
self, & after ripped
out his guts.
