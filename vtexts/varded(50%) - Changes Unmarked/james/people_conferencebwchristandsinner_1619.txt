A Christian conference between
Christ and a Sinner, wherein is showed the Love of Christ towards
Mankind, and the pains which he suffered upon the Cross for our sins
together with the wickedness of our corrupt natures toward him for
the same To the tune of Go to bed sweet heart.
I Am a poor sinner, how should I begin,
     to fall from my folly and horrible sin,
I Know not to whom I should make my complaint
     my sins are so heinous my heart it doth faint.
My conscience accuses me, no man can comfort me
Succour me sweet Christ I would come to thee.

Christ.
O thou sinful creature why dost thou despair,
     can thou not settle thy self unto prayer:
By faith and repentance if thou wilt relent,
     and fall from the former life thou hast ill spent:
And turn away from thy sin, that's the way to begin
I that redeemed thee bids thee come to me.

The Sinner.
Alas, when to pray to thee I have intended,
     My conscience doth tell me I have so offended
That thou wilt deny my request in my prayer,
     and this (O Lord) causes me thus to despair.
My conscience accuses me, etc.

Christ.
Where dost thou find in my holy bible,
     that nothing with me can be unpossible:
For were thine iniquity never so great,
     my mercy surpasses it, if thou wilt entreat.
And turn away, etc

Sinner.
O how my body doth tremble and shake,
     my soul is unquiet my heart it doth ache:
The Devil doth temp and lead me to ill,
     enforcing that thou wilt be angry still,
My conscience accuses me, etc.

Christ.
Believe not the Devil for all his delay,
     for his subtle slight is to work thy decay:
Think how I converted my Apostle S. Paul,
     by mercy and favour which I give to you all.
Turn away. etc.

Sinner.
How apt is ill counsel to lead me to vice,
     how doth the world daily my fancy entice,
Adversity pinches me every hour,
     I dread not thy judgement, thy justice and power.
My conscience accuses me, etc.

Christ.
O earth and slime learn thou to shun all annoy,
     and suffer with patience, so shalt thou have joy,
Consider what pain I have suffered for thee,
     enduring all torments to set thy soul free.
Then turn away, etc.

Sinner.
O my sweet Saviour, I cannot deny,
     but that for my filthy offence thou did die.
And what cruel pangs thou abidst in the Garden,
     and daily sweet Jesus thou pleadst for my pardon
[My conscience accuseth me, etc.]

Christ.
Then since thou confessed that I am thy Saviour,
     behold which way thou shalt attain to my favour
Examine thy sins and be sorry therefore,
     and never commit such offence any more.
Then turn away, etc.

Sinner.
Alas, I am feeble and have not the face,
     take hold of thy promise except thy sweet grace,
My carcass is filthy and nothing but clay,
     send help I beseech thee or else I decay.
My conscience accuses me, etc.

Christ.
If once I do see thee be sorry in heart,
     amending thy life, and in time will convert,
Let nothing dismay thee for I will receive thee,
     let all thy familiar and worldly friends leave thee
Then turn away, etc.

Sinner.
Then Lord in thy mercy is all my whole stay,
     permit not foul Satan to cast me away,
From that filthy tyrant sweet Jesus defend me.
     he leads my affections, and still doth attend me.
And daily he tells me, no man, etc.

Christ.
Say to him thus when he would thee devour,
     avoid wicked Satan thou hast no more power,
But that which my God doth permit unto thee,
     thou hast not the power to be master ore me,
Believe not his treachery, that's the, etc.

Sinner.
I thank thee sweet Jesus that of thy good grace.
     thou stand to assist me in every place.
Yet I am disloyal unjust and perverse,
     no creature more filthy that I can rehearse.
My conscience accuses me, etc.

Christ.
Take up thy cross and follow then me,
     with patience continue and look that thou be,
For all thine offences repentant with sorrow,
     think death is at hand to present thee tomorrow,
Then turn away from thy sin, that's the way to begin
I that redeemed thee bids thee come to me.

Sinner.
My filthy unworthiness here I confess,
     forgive me, O Saviour and send me redress:
Increase my faith and patience that I may
     attain to thy presence, and boldly may say,
Depart from me vanity, Christ hath released me,
Succour me sweet Christ, I would come to thee.
