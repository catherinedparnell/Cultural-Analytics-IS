A greater thanks, for Churchyards
welcome home.
I Bad not Court farewell
     for such hot welcome home,
But glad to leave the costly Court
     and lyve like country mom.

From thence I willing went:
     and thought in very deed,
To make (ere mischiefs fell on heaps)
     a Virtue of a need.

But my cheeff friend came there,
     to whom for duties sake
I rode, and did (by destinies lot)
     a further journey make.

Which friend drew me by love,
     to see the Court again:
But sens my sudden coming there
     doth breed in you disdain:

I find more fumish flames,
     by this fond frantic smoke:
And see (perhaps) a further fire,
     then you with craft can cloak.

But till your fingers burn,
     ye care not what ye doe:
Well, I will help to kindle coals,
     and clap on faggots toe.

To bring your hands in heat,
     because the ayre is cold:
Call. me: Knave thee: I say no more,
     the proverb is full old.

If Crows of Cheap cry Call,
     the bawl doth back rebound:
For sure I owe not all their town,
     the half of twenty pound.

And thirteen sandals great,
     o every pound allow:
Then call an audit of my debt,
     and cast my charges now.

Yet know I cut tailed Cures,
     can never bight in frame:
Till courage claps them on the backs
     and thrusts them on the game.

Come on you snaring whelps
     I fear your force no whit:
Though loud ye bark ye dare not byte
     your teeth are tender yet.

Baight me like Bull at stake,
     I have good flesh and bone:
To try it out (as hap shall serve)
     with any Dog alone.

No other answer sure,
     I make: now skin this well:
But leave the Lob that rayld on me,
     the babble and the bell.

Write not to this again,
     in silence shall ye sit:
As void of answer every way,
     as you are void of wit.
